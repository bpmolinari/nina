## Italian records

The
[FamilySearch wiki](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Main_Page)
provides an entry for
[Italy Genealogy](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Genealogy).
The records of interest are the
[civil registration](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Civil_Registration)
records, kept systematically since just after the modern state of Italy came
into existence in 1861. Before that, the records were kept, parish by parish,
by the Church.


The civil records maintained at the comune, by a local registrar.
Two copies were made, with one copy kept in the comune and the other sent
to the provincial center (in this case the town of Sondrio).

The birth records (for example) for a year were kept in a volume,
with each birth record entered in sequence, and numbered.
At the end of the year a name-number index was compiled,
and written in the last pages of the volume. 


## The Tirano records on microfilm

I first became aware of the records through an article
*Family history, a new resource for family historians: microfilms of vital records from the archivio tribunale* in 
[Volume 14, Number 1](https://www.coasit.com.au/images/ihs/journals/IHSJ_vol14_n1_2006.pdf)
of the Italian Historical Society Journal.
The author, Alan Poletti, explained how these records for several provinces, including Sondrio, had been committed to microfilm by the Church of Jesus Chris of the Latter-Day Saints.
To view them in 2005 he had to request that the physical microfilms were sent to a nearby Family History Centre of the Church.

## The Tirano records online

Clicking on the **Sondrio, Lombardy** entry in the
[civil registration](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Civil_Registration)
page shows that on-line civil registration records are available through
two paths:

- direct search. The link under section 2 of that page is a dud link.
Going to the **search** entry on the FamilySearch homepage and entering
Sondrio into **Find a Collection** will provide the
[correct link](https://www.familysearch.org/search/collection/2043841).
Selecting, in turn, Browse Images, Sondrio, and Tirano, gets you
[here](https://www.familysearch.org/search/image/index?owc=M7SY-ZTL%3A350267401%2C350275301%3Fcc%3D2043841). There are 9 micro-film images, which can be
viewed with a film viewer app.

- catalogue search. Section 3 of that page outlines a catalogue search that
gets you
[here](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/993153?availability=Family%20History%20Library).
There are 16 catalogue entries, of which 10 can be viewed on-line.

In either case, clicking on any of the available entries opens
a film-viewer app.
I find it convenient to select the Browse multiple images mode (selector
on top left).

## Indexes (sort of)

There are nine microfilms, each represented by a data structure matching the sequence of images on the film. For example the record *Nati 1866-1886* contains 1,579 images. One can click through these in sequence (exactly as with a microfilm reader) but of more use is the ability to directly access an image by sequence number.

An inspection shows that the 1897 volume occupies images 5 to 38, the 1898 volume occupies images 39 to 65, and so on. As I wanted work through most of the records I identified the location of each volume in the microfilm record. I also recorded the location of the annual index.

### Nati 1866-1886

This is one long collection of 1597 images. It is the digital scan of 21 annual registers.  In an annual register the records are carefully numbered in sequence; there are about 200 records each year. At the end of each register is an alphabetic index for the year, showing index number.

In my Family Tree I have recorded my grandfather's birth as being recorded by
	Comune di Tirano, Registro degli Atti di Nascita, 1882, No 12
To find the birth certificate, check the index for 1882, namely image 1183 (or nearby). There are 3 records per image, so look in the fourth image. They start at image 1186, so look in image 1190.
