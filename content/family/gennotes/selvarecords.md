## Italian records

The
[FamilySearch wiki](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Main_Page)
provides an entry for
[Italy Genealogy](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Genealogy).
The records of interest are the
[civil registration](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Civil_Registration)
records, kept systematically since just after the modern state of Italy came
into existence in 1861. Before that, the records were kept, parish by parish,
by the Church.

## Selva di Cadore records On-Line

Clicking on the **Belluno, Veneto** entry in the
[civil registration](https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Italy_Civil_Registration)
page shows that on-line civil registration records are available through
Ancestry.com, and not through FamilySearch.

It turns out that Ancestry.com can be accessed by members of the ACT Library system.

The Selva records are better structured that the Tirano records.
They are available on a year-by-year basis, with the name-index available as a 
separate volume (generally one page long).
There is thus no need to construct an index, as for the Titano records.

About 10% of the year-volumes are missing, and some of the surviving ones
consist of little more than ink blotches.
The registrar's cat must have tipped over the ink-well.
