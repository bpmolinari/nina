## Introduction

My paternal grandfather is Giovan' Domenico Molinari (1882-1959). He was born in Tirano, Sondrio, Italy and emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1900.
Three siblings (two brothers and a sister) migrated from Tirano to Perth in the first eight years of the twentieth century. What was the context of them leaving at that time, and why Australia?

The family recorded history and oral history is rather weak. The sister died early (in 1941). The younger brother went back to Tirano in 1975. They didn't much write to one another, or at least didn't reply to letters.

In 2021 I discovered that the civil records (births, marriages and deaths) for the province of Sondrio were available online (see
[technotes](/family/gennotes/tiranorecords)).
That has allowed a family tree for my Molinari ancestors to be constructed,
and some of the family story to be identified.

## The Tirano Context ##

This is provided by 

Jacqueline Templeton, "From the Mountains to the Bush: Italian migrants write home from Australia, 1860-1962", University of Western Australia Press, 2003.

This is a study of migration from the area of Italy. It constituted the great majority of migration in the 1880-1914 time. The area was agricultural and poor. The population was small landholders and poor. Land was in short supply. There was a tradition of younger sons working outside the area either seasonally or for a number of years. Money was sent back regularly, of accumulated until return. This happened in Europe (Switzerland, France) where unskilled farm labouring jobs were available. To some extent this system was transferred to Australia.

The author has found access to a number of letters from the (single) sojourners in Austral back to Tirano. Many stories tell of isolation and loneliness. They tended to work together on small contacting arrangements, and the opportunities of interaction with the broader community were limited.

A broader story is told in the book "Sojourners", for the Chinese migration to Australia in the nineteenth century.

There is a considerable amount of Italian-Australian studies now available.  The journal
[Italian Historical Society](https://www.coasit.com.au/italian-historical-society/ihs-journal)
has a number of articles, and in fact lead me to find the Sondrio records.

## Bernardo Molinari (1842-1918) ##


For the Molinari ancestors, it is convenient to show a
family tree for my great-grandfather Bernardo. This is shown
in-line, and it is best viewed at a zoom of 1005 or bigger.
For convenience a link to a full=screen version is provided in the caption.

Family tree: Bernardo Molinari [fullscreen](BernardoMolinari.pdf)

Bernardo was the youngest of five siblings.
As far as we can see, his parents and his siblings were all born in Tirano
and spent
all their lives there.

Bernardo (1842-1918) was married FOUR times. Wives and children:

1. Maria Beccaria (haven't found the marriage registro - records started in 1866)

- Domenico 1868 lived 6 days
- Bernardo 1869 lived 2 days
- unnamed girl 17 Dec 1871 "non e' vivo"

Maria died  24 December 1871 in Tirano (obviously from complications), aged 30

2. Marta Tudori (married 1873, age 25)

- Maria Domenica 24 Nov 1874 lived 6 days
- Domenica Marta 27 Feb 1876 lived 2 days

Marta died 20 Nov 1876 in Teglio, aged 28)

3. Maria Reghenzani (married 01 Mar 1878, age 33)

- Domenica 18 Sep 1878 died 2 Sep 1879
- Maria Domenica 23 Feb 1880  (married Giacom' Pianta)
- Giovan Domenico 16 Jan 1882 (grandfather Dom - note the name)
- Bernardo 3 Sep 1883 died 25 Apr 1886
- Rose Palmira 25 Apr 1885  Died 3 Sep 1886
- Bernardo 16 Nov 1886 "lived 10 minutes"
- Bernardo 26 Nov 1887 (Uncle Barney)

Maria died 22 Oct 1902 in Tirano, aged 57

4. Maria Caterina Rossi (married 6 Mar 1904, age 36)

No children and I can't see when she died. Bernardo was 62 at this stage.

None of his wives came from Tirano - God only knows how he found them and persuaded them to marry him.

He seems to have spent the time 1888-1901 (or thereabouts) in Australia.

- Domenico Molinari of Madonna di Tirano emigrated to Australia in 1888, leaving his wife and three children. The younger of two brothers, Bernardo, was 2 when his father left but nearly 14 when he returned twelve years later and immediately expected obedience. To Bernardo, his father was a usurper whose authority he refused to recognise and, as soon as he was able, he left permanently for Australia, following his brother who had already gone, perhaps for the same reasons. (Templeton, page 93, who attributes the information to a conversation with Bernardo's daughter Roma).

- The travel date is probably correct. There is a Bernardo Molinari ("workman, aged 32) on the [passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/4269E182-F96C-11E9-AE98-D719FDAA70E0?image=116
) of the Salier which 
[arrived in Melbourne](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6896982) on 03 August 1888.
The age given is wrong (he was 46) but there seems to have been no requirements to carry an identity document which could be checked. 
The baby Bernardo was not yet 1.

- He is still away in April 1901. On his daughter's marriage certificate (in Tirano) his address is recorded as "ignota in Australia" (unknown in Australia).

- He was back in Tirano when Maria died in October 1902.

No details of his stay in Australia have been found and no record of his return trip to Italy. There is a vague family story that there was a second trip to Australia, and indeed that he had another family there. If there was, indeed, a second trip he would have "abandoned" his fourth wife when in his early sixties.

In any event, he was back in Tirano when he died in 1918.


## Maria Reghenzani (1845-1902) ##

It is convenient to show a separate family tree for my
great-grandmother (as not all details can be mapped into
a single tree).

{{< pdf src="MariaReghenzani.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" >}}
Family tree: Maria Reghenzani [fullscreen](MariaReghenzani.pdf)

Maria was the oldest of four siblings. She was born in the comune of Teglio, some 10km down the valley from Tirano.
Her parents and siblings were born in Teglio, and seemed to have spent their entire lives there.

Maria  was married THREE times, each time in Tirano. Husbands and children:

1. Giovanni D'Abbondi (haven't found the registro - records started in 1866)

No children in the period of the records. Giovanni died in 1870 aged 47.

2. Domenico Ferrari (married 1872, he was 51)

- Maria Giovanna 20 May 1873, Married Giovanni Molinari
- Caterina 25 Aug 1874, Married Andrea Ferrari

Domenico died 1 Feb 1875 aged 54.

3. Bernardo Molinari (see above)

When Bernardo disappeared on his 12-year sojourn in Australia, Maria had in fact five children to look after, aged 15, 14, 8, 6 and 1 years.
The older two were from her earlier marriage to Domenico Ferrari.
It is not clear that she even knew where Bernardo was (see the above
comment from his daughter Domenica's marriage certificate), so
it is not clear that he regularly sent money back.
By the time Bernardo returned the oldest three (all girls) were married and the next (my grandfather) had left for Australia.
A family story has that his main childhood memory was of being hungry, with
meat being afforded only several times a year.

Life was clearly cheap in Tirano. By my reckoning Bernardo had 12 children, of whom only three reached maturity.
Maria had 9 children (7 with Bernardo), of whom five reached maturity.

There were a large number of Molinaris and Piantas and Ferraris in Tirano, but almost none in the next communes Villa di Tirano and Teglio. Clearly it was a tribal way of life.



## The Migrant Generation

The three Molinari siblings migrated to Perth in close succession: Dom in 1900, Maria Domenica in 1907 and Bernardo in 1908. They left two half-sisters in Tirano (from their mother's earlier marriage).
The second of those sisters, Caterina Ferrari, had three children, of whom two also migrated to Perth: Eliza Ferrari in 1923 and Battista Del Torre in 1924.
The first sister, Maria Giovanna Ferrari, stayed in Tirano and her family were the rather indistinct "Tirano relatives" of my childhood. She had married Giovanni Molinari, so these relatives bore the Molinari surname (but from a different family).

### Domenico Molinari

For the first time, we have a photograph.
This is Domenico at his marriage to Giacinta Dall'Acqua in 1911, aged 29.

{{< figure src="DomenicoGiacintaMolinari.jpeg" 
           caption="Domenico Molinari and Giacinta Dall'Acqua. Wedding. 1911" >}}

Then owned a hotel in Day Dawn, in 1918.

{{< figure src="CosmopolitanHotelDayDawn1918.jpeg" >}}

Then blacksmith in Cue. Gold possession. Retirement. My memories.

### Domenica Molinari and Giacomo Pianta

Married Giacomo Pianta in Tirano. He moved to Perth in 1902, leaving Domenica and son behind. Do not have a photo of Domenica, but one of the brothers in law.

{{< figure src="DomenicoMolinariGiacomoPianta.jpeg"

Sad story. Did not come out until 1907. They run a diary farm. Husband was seriously injured and committed to a nursing home. Commits suicide in 1941.

### Bernardo Molinari

Comes out in 1908. Works in New Norcia for eight years. Business man. Somewhat of an unofficial consul, facilitating Italian immigrants.

Marries the daughter of his half-sister but she dies after three years. Marries again.

has daughter in 1930.

Trip to Tirano in 1975. House vandalised after six months. Stays in Tirano.
