## Introduction

My paternal grandfather is Giovan' Domenico Molinari (1882-1959). He was born in Tirano, Sondrio, Italy and emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1900.
Three siblings (two brothers and a sister) migrated from Tirano to Perth in the first eight years of the twentieth century. What was the context of them leaving at that time, and why Australia?

The family recorded history and oral history is rather weak. The sister died early (in 1941). The younger brother went back to Tirano in 1975. They didn't much write to one another, or at least didn't reply to letters.
One resource we do have is some [notes](HowiesonNotes.pdf)
made by my second cousin Noel Howieson. Much of the information she records was provided by our mutual first cousin Roma Molinari. It turns out that some of the details provided by Roma were incorrect.

In 2021 I discovered that the civil records (births, marriages and deaths) for the province of Sondrio were available online (see
[technotes](/family/gennotes/tiranorecords)).
That has allowed a family tree for my Molinari ancestors to be constructed,
and some of the family story to be identified.

## The Tirano Context ##

This is provided by 

Jacqueline Templeton, "From the Mountains to the Bush: Italian migrants write home from Australia, 1860-1962", University of Western Australia Press, 2003.

This is a study of migration from the area of Italy. It constituted the great majority of migration in the 1880-1914 time. The area was agricultural and poor. The population was small landholders and poor. Land was in short supply. There was a tradition of younger sons working outside the area either seasonally or for a number of years. Money was sent back regularly, of accumulated until return. This happened in Europe (Switzerland, France) where unskilled farm labouring jobs were available. To some extent this system was transferred to Australia.

The author has found access to a number of letters from the (single) sojourners in Austral back to Tirano. Many stories tell of isolation and loneliness. They tended to work together on small contacting arrangements, and the opportunities of interaction with the broader community were limited.

A broader story is told in the book "Sojourners", for the Chinese migration to Australia in the nineteenth century.

There is a considerable amount of Italian-Australian studies now available.  The journal
[Italian Historical Society](https://www.coasit.com.au/italian-historical-society/ihs-journal)
has a number of articles, and in fact lead me to find the Sondrio records.

## Bernardo Molinari (1842-1918) ##


For the Molinari ancestors, it is convenient to show a
family tree for my great-grandfather Bernardo. This is shown
in-line, and it is best viewed at a zoom of 100% or bigger.
For convenience a link to a full-screen version is provided in the caption.

Family tree: Bernardo Molinari [fullscreen](BernardoMolinari.pdf)

Bernardo was the youngest of five siblings.
As far as we can see, his parents and his siblings were all born in Tirano
and spent
all their lives there.

Bernardo (1842-1918) was married FOUR times. Wives and children:

1. Maria Beccaria (haven't found the marriage registro - records started in 1866)

- Domenico 1868 lived 6 days
- Bernardo 1869 lived 2 days
- unnamed girl 17 Dec 1871 "non e' vivo"

Maria died  24 December 1871 in Tirano (obviously from complications), aged 30

2. Marta Tudori (married 1873, age 25)

- Maria Domenica 24 Nov 1874 lived 6 days
- Domenica Marta 27 Feb 1876 lived 2 days

Marta died 20 Nov 1876 in Teglio, aged 28)

3. Maria Reghenzani (married 01 Mar 1878, age 33)

- Domenica 18 Sep 1878 died 2 Sep 1879
- Maria Domenica 23 Feb 1880  (married Giacom' Pianta)
- Giovan Domenico 16 Jan 1882 (grandfather Dom - note the name)
- Bernardo 3 Sep 1883 died 25 Apr 1886
- Rose Palmira 25 Apr 1885  Died 3 Sep 1886
- Bernardo 16 Nov 1886 "lived 10 minutes"
- Bernardo 26 Nov 1887 (Uncle Barney)

Maria died 22 Oct 1902 in Tirano, aged 57

4. Maria Caterina Rossi (married 6 Mar 1904, age 36)

No children and I can't see when she died. Bernardo was 62 at this stage.

None of his wives came from Tirano - God only knows how he found them and persuaded them to marry him.

He seems to have spent the time 1888-1901 (or thereabouts) in Australia.

> Domenico Molinari of Madonna di Tirano emigrated to Australia in 1888, leaving his wife and three children. The younger of two brothers, Bernardo, was 2 when his father left but nearly 14 when he returned twelve years later and immediately expected obedience. To Bernardo, his father was a usurper whose authority he refused to recognise and, as soon as he was able, he left permanently for Australia, following his brother who had already gone, perhaps for the same reasons.

(Templeton, page 93, who attributes the information to a conversation with Bernardo's daughter Roma).

- The travel date is probably correct. There is a Bernardo Molinari ("workman", aged 32) on the [passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/4269E182-F96C-11E9-AE98-D719FDAA70E0?image=116
) of the Salier which 
[arrived in Melbourne](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6896982) on 03 August 1888.
The age given is wrong (he was 46) but there seems to have been no requirements to carry an identity document which could be checked. 
The baby Bernardo was not yet 1.

- He is still away in April 1901. On his daughter's marriage certificate (in Tirano) his address is recorded as "ignota in Australia" (unknown in Australia).

- He was back in Tirano when Maria died in October 1902.

No details of his stay in Australia have been found and no record of his return trip to Italy. There is a vague family story that there was a second trip to Australia, and indeed that he had another family there. If there was, indeed, a second trip he would have "abandoned" his fourth wife when in his early sixties.

In any event, he was back in Tirano when he died in 1918.


## Maria Reghenzani (1845-1902) ##

It is convenient to show a separate family tree for my
great-grandmother (as not all details can be mapped into
a single tree).

{{< pdf src="MariaReghenzani.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" >}}
Family tree: Maria Reghenzani [fullscreen](MariaReghenzani.pdf)

Maria was the oldest of four siblings. She was born in the comune of Teglio, some 10km down the valley from Tirano.
Her parents and siblings were born in Teglio, and seemed to have spent their entire lives there.

Maria  was married THREE times, each time in Tirano. Husbands and children:

1. Giovanni D'Abbondi (haven't found the registro - records started in 1866)

No children in the period of the records. Giovanni died in 1870 aged 47.

2. Domenico Ferrari (married 1872, he was 51)

- Maria Giovanna 20 May 1873, Married Giovanni Molinari
- Caterina 25 Aug 1874, Married Andrea Ferrari

Domenico died 1 Feb 1875 aged 54.

3. Bernardo Molinari (see above)

When Bernardo disappeared on his 12-year sojourn in Australia, Maria had in fact five children to look after, aged 15, 14, 8, 6 and 1 years.
The older two were from her earlier marriage to Domenico Ferrari.
It is not clear that she even knew where Bernardo was (see the above
comment from his daughter Domenica's marriage certificate), so
it is not clear that he regularly sent money back.
By the time Bernardo returned the oldest three (all girls) were married and the next (my grandfather) had left for Australia.
A family story has that his main childhood memory was of being hungry, with
meat being afforded only several times a year.

Remarkably, we have a photograph from this period, taken in about 1885.

{{< figure src="MolinariTirano1885.jpeg" default="true"
           caption="Molinari Family. Tirano 1885" 
		   width="384" height="307" >}}

It shows Maria and Bernardo, seated.
At the back are Maria's daughters Maria Giovanna and Caterina, from her earlier marriage to Domenico Ferrari.
At the front are their son Domenico (aged about 2) and their daughter Maria Domenica (aged about 4). Their third child is not yet born.

The photo is in the [carte de visite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carte_de_visite) format.
This was a relatively affordable technology, where the photo was directly printed from a negative without any enlargement.
The photographer has added a little colouring by hand.

The resolution of this image is very poor, only 256x205 pixels. I do not have access to the original photograph.
Rather, a photo of the original was taken by my second cousin Noel xx, and what I have is a scan of that second-generation photo.

Life was clearly cheap in Tirano. By my reckoning Bernardo had 12 children, of whom only three reached maturity.
Maria had 9 children (7 with Bernardo), of whom five reached maturity.

There were a large number of Molinaris and Piantas and Ferraris in Tirano, but almost none in the next communes Villa di Tirano and Teglio. Clearly it was a tribal way of life.



## The Migrant Generation

The three Molinari siblings migrated to Perth in close succession: Domenico in 1900, Bernardo in 1908, and Maria Domenica in 1916. They left two half-sisters in Tirano (from their mother's earlier marriage).
The second of those sisters, Caterina Ferrari, had three children, of whom two also migrated to Perth: Eliza Ferrari in 1923 and Battista Del Torre in 1924.
The first sister, Maria Giovanna Ferrari, stayed in Tirano and her family were the rather indistinct "Tirano relatives" of my childhood. She had married Giovanni Molinari, so these relatives bore the Molinari surname (but from a different family).

### Domenico Molinari (1882-1959)

Dominic arrived in Perth (or, more precisely, the port of Fremantle)
on the Nord-Lloyd ship *Gera* on 10 April 1900. 
He was just 18 years old and clearly would have spoken barely a word of English.
Family folklore has it that he had trained as a [wheelwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelwright). 

The [passenger list](DominicMolinari1900.pdf) is available. It shows that he was one of four Italians who joined the boat in Antwerp, rather than being among the group of 29 who joined the boat in Genoa - the latter option being the cheaper and more convenient.
Being 18 years of age, he was liable for military service, and would have needed a passport to be able to board the ship in Italy. Being sound of wind and limb he would not have been the passport until he had completed military service.
The alternative was to cross the nearby Swiss border, and head to Belgium by train. It looks like two of the other three Antwerp passengers may have been in the same situation.

It is convenient to show a timeline of where he lived and worked.

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem header="1900-1902 Mundaring" >}}
It seems that his first job was on the constuction of Mundaring Weir.
This was part of the largest public works program of the time in WA, and it was noted for the involvement of a large group of immigrant workers with poor English language skills.
Noel Howieson's notes says that her grandfather was in fact in WA at the time, working on the dam project (he returned to Tirano). This may well have been the motivation for Dominic to choose WA.
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem header="1902-1916 Greenmount" >}}
Dominic's application
for naturalisation says that he moved to Greenmount in 1902. He and Giacinta lived there after their marriage, and their first three children were born there. 
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem header="1916-1920 Day Dawn" >}}
Dominic was the publican of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem header="1920-1953 Cue" >}}
Dominic ran a blacksmith's shop (perhaps the only one in town).
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem header="1953-1959 Osborne Park" >}}
They retired to a small property (several acres) in the market garden area of Perth.

This is Domenico at his marriage to Giacinta Dall'Acqua in 1911, aged 29.

{{< figure src="DomenicoGiacintaMolinari.jpeg" 
           caption="Domenico Molinari and Giacinta Dall'Acqua. Wedding. 1911" >}}

He
[applied](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Gallery151/dist/JGalleryViewer.aspx?B=12840&S=2&N=10&R=0#/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ShowImage.aspx?B=12840&T=P&S=5)
for naturalisation in 1911, soon after his marriage. As wife, Giacinta obtained the status automatically.

The
[York Coffee Palace](yorkcoffeepalace),
at 557-559 Wellington Street, Perth plays a key role in the affairs of Dominic, his brother Bernardo, and his brother-in-law Giacomo.
Clearly, it finished up in the management (and presumed ownership) of Bernardo
from about 1920.
Family folklore has it that Dominic and Giacomo owned the property, and that they were later bought out by Bernardo.
Giacomo used his capital to buy a dairy farm about 1915, and Dominic used his capital to buy the
[Cosmopolitan Hotel](murchison) in Day Dawn about 1916.

It is hard to pin this down. Perhaps a key event was in 1906, when Giovanni Gettaz acquired a *colonial wine licence* and hence opened a wine saloon on the premises.
It is possible that Dominic and Giacomo had built up some savings by then - it was certainly the Tirano ethos to do so.
It seems clear that the York, with its wine saloon and its accommodation, became a focus of the Italian community.
My reading is that it was a three-way arrangement between Dominic, Giacom and Giovanni Gettaz.
The only explicit link is that Gettaz left at about the same time, and the licence was shifted (briefly) to Giacomo.
The story is taken in more detail in my discussion of Bernardo.

The family machinations are much more evident for the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
The starting point is clear.
The owner of the hotel, Pietro Ceruti,
[gave](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92565479)
the York as his address in October 1914 (on his return from his disastrous commercial traveller trip to Sydney).
At his
[bankruptcy hearing](nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81170780 )
in June 1915 he says he has 

>three secured creditors, covered by mortgages to the total of 1,298 pounds. The three secured creditors are Italian.

One mortgagee was
[certainly](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81725887) Dominic,
and I believe the others were Bernardo and Giovanni Gettaz.
The old rogue Pietro had sold them a pup.
In fact the luckless licensee of 1915, Urbain Martin, had been in some sort of partnership with Dominic and Giovanni. He had expended some 358 pounds, expecting to be reimbursed. Gettaz had paid up, but 
he took Dominic to 
[court](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81725887) for the money.
Dominic [lost](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81353797).

The story now starts to look like a Greek tragedy.
Dominic and Bernardo are now co-owners of the hotel, and Bernardo wants his money out. To this effect he forces Dominic into a
[bankruptcy hearing](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27293611)
in March 1917 (he seems to be the only creditor).
He said that he and Dominic had been partners on a half-share basis

> They kept no books. After about fourteen months he retired from the partnership, not being able to agree with his brother's wife. He had also taken over a mortgage on the hotel at a cost of 400 pounds and this he still held.

Dominic [cleared](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27302908) cleared the bankruptcy in June 1917.

Finally, a mortgagee sale of the hotel was
[advertised](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27306514)
for 3 August 1917. This must have been initiated by Bernardo, to get at his capital
It is not clear that the sale ever took place. Maybe Dominic settled it somehow.
Who knows, at this remove, why they could not have managed a settlement without recourse to such drama and expense. Maybe it says something about the Italian temperament.

Family legend has it that they were permanently estranged. Some 35 years later they lived in Perth in the same suburb (Osborne Park), but never spoke to one another.

In the event Dominic ran the hotel for another two years. At the end of 1919 the licence lapsed and the hotel was
[sold](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233282736)
as an empty building.

>Station Owners and Others: Tenders, addressed J. Metzke, Meekatharra, are invited for Purchase of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Day Dawn, as a going concern or for removal. This is a well-built two-storey building and contains approximately 15 tons corrugated iron.

Day Dawn had imploded.
Although family legend has it that he made good money while running the hotel, it would seem that he would have emerged from the adventure with very little of his capital intact. On the other hand, Bernardo had the York Coffee Palace and Giacomo had his diary farm.
Perhaps Dominic rued the day when they responded to the siren sales pitch of Pietro Ceruti.

The family moved eight kilometres up the dusty road to Cue and Dominic ran a smithy business (blacksmith, farrier and wheelwright). This was his original trade. Perhaps he took over an existing business - Lord knows he wouldn't have to pay much for it. In the 1923 edition of the Western Australian Directory [Wise's] there are two blacksmiths listed for Cue (population 600).
In the 1930 edition, Dominic is the only one.

Two events appear in the public record. In 1927 there was a
[dispute](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article257301430)
about a goat. Dominic sued one Maurice Fielberg for its return, but was unsuccessful. The case showed that many households kept a small flock of goats, presumably for meat and where possible, milk. These goats roamed around the environs of the town,being recognised by their markings. The notion of possession seemed fluid.

The second event was Dominic's
[conviction](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49035331) in June 1952 for being in unlawful possession of gold.

>Dominic Molinari (70), married, blacksmith, was charged in the Cue Police Court today, before Warden Harwood. with having been in the unlawful possession of gold. He pleaded not guilty but was sentenced to three months' hard labour and fined £50. He pleaded guilty to a charge of having had unregistered appliances and was fined £25. Det.Sgt. Douglas, of the Gold Stealing Detection Staff, said that a search of Molinari's blacksmith shop had revealed 26 crucibles, five gold moulds and other equipment used for smelting. Molinari had claimed that certain material was brass, but on assay it proved to be 80 per cent gold. Evidence was given that some of the gold tailings which formed part of the charge assayed at a rate of 200 ounces a ton.

Presumably he had been happy to take gold (in lieu of cash) for blacksmithing services. Gold, to a traditional Italian, would have been better than cash. Maybe he was regarded as a small-scale local "fence". In any event it was hardly a unique offence. A search of *The West Australian* for 1952 shows dozens of similar cases, all fairly small beer. Security in the gold mining and refining process was pretty weak, and this was offset making gold possession, ipso facto, a punishable offence. Three months hard seemed to be the minimum sentence.

It was little spoken of in the family. Family legend had it that Dominic was extremely wary of banks. Cash was carefully buried (literally) rather than banked. This caused drama when the burial spot was temporarily mistaken. It was also suggested that not all the gold was seized by Sgt. Douglas.

The business was
[advertised](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55798566) in April 1953:

> BLACKSMITH and Wheelwright shop with tools and machinery for sale, iron building 66ft. x 44ft, Apply G. Molinari. Cue. 

They moved to xx Street, Osborne Park on the (then) outskirts of Perth, and adopted a somewhat nostalgic lifestyle. They grew grapes and, I think, made wine. There were chickens and, I think, a cow. Some of his wrought iron stock from the blacksmith's shop was too close to him to part with, and Dominic had it transported at great cost to Perth. They lived there until Dominic died, aged 77. Giacinta eventually moved to a nursing home in Bunbury, where she died in 1973, aged 90.

### Domenica Molinari (1880-1941) and Giacomo Pianta (1877-1945)

Domenica and Giacomo were married in Tirano in April 1901. Their only child Giacomo Pietro was born in Tirano in June 1901.

It is hard to be precise about their movement, but there is no reason to doubt the information given in Noel's notes.
Giacomo came to Perth in about 1906, but I can't find him on a passenger list. (There is a Giacomo Pianta who arrived in 1902, but that would not seem to be him). On his application for naturalisation (in 1927), Giacomo Pietro says he arrived on the *Osterley* on March 1916. With his mother Domenica, one would presume. But they do not appear on the passenger list. Passing strange.

Luigi Pianta (Giacomo's brother) is on the
[passenger list](LuigiPiantaOrtona1902.pdf)
of the *Ortona*, arriving in Fremantle on 5 March 1902 (he is number 9 in the list of italians who embarked at Naples). In particular

- Against each passenger is written a WA contact, the passenger's trade, and a money amount (presumably the cash that the passenger was carrying). This looks like some sort of migration agent was involved.

- Luigi is a labourer, and nominates a brother in Mundaring. He has a brother-in-law, Dominic, in Mundaring. Close enough.

Luigi's 
[passport application](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=14573)
in November 1912 tells us that he lived in Greenmount for five years until 1907, and then moved to Osborne Park. We know that Dominic moved to Greenmount in about 1902. The Tiranese stuck together.

We know Giacomo was naturalised in May 1911, but his file has not been digitised.
That he had a close association with Dominic is clear from the fact he was the best man at Dominic's wedding. I do not have a photo of Domenica.

{{< figure src="DomenicoMolinariGiacomoPianta.jpeg"
           caption= "Domenico Molinari and Giacomo Pianta. 1911" >}}

We have the 1927 
[naturalisation application](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=1507348)
by Giacomo Pietro (Nino, also Jim). Although his father Giacomo had been naturalised in 1911, Nino was still resident in Italy and hence didn't inherit the status.
On the other hand, Domenica *did* automatically obtain the status, as a wife.

Giacomo and Domenica acquired a dairy farm on the Glendalogh Estate. 

> The name honours a Catholic centre in Ireland, where a hermitage was established in the 7th Century. A crown grant for Glendalough and a portion of Herdsman Lake was made in 1837 to Thomas Helms and eventually transferred to Bishop Gibney in 1887, who leased much of it to market gardeners.
The locality of Glendalough has a strong association with the Catholic Church with the northern portion passing through several orders of the Roman Catholic Church until 1921, when the Little Sisters of the Poor used it as a site for a rest home.
In 1949, the State Housing Commission bought part of Glendalough for subdivision and began to develop the area.

It seems that they would have leased the land (as the Catholic Church never sells unless it is forced to). A notice in *The West Australian* of 31 May 1915:

> STRAYED into paddock, black and white Calf. Owner may have same by paying expenses. Pianta, Glendalough Dairy, Leederville.

gives a starting date for the farm.

In November 1926 he was severely injured:

> James Pianta was admitted to the Perth Hospital from Osborne Park late last night suffering from severe head injuries, and soon after admission his name was placed on the danger list. No information could be obtained concerning the manner, in which he received his injuries.

He never recovered, and was looked after at The Little Sister's of the Poor home on the Glendalough Estate. He died in 1945.

Domenica was left to run the diary farm, with Nino and hired help. Nino was married in 1928 and, presumably, sought to go his own way. In September 1941 she committed suicide.
*The Daily News* of 25 October 1941 gives a basic
[account](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78566435)
of the inquest. The *Mirror* gives a more
[lurid account](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76002240)
Reference is made to her invalid husband and to chronic asthma problems.
A suicide note was written in Italian. Even after 25 years in Australia she had not developed good English written skills.

In June 1942 the farm was
[advertised](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94827806)
for sale, described as "a registered wholesale  dairy farm, of 94 acres, being in Harbour Street about 5 miles from the city".

### Bernardo Molinari

Comes out in 1908. Works in New Notch for eight years. Business man. Somewhat of an unofficial consul, facilitating Italian immigrants.

Marries the daughter of his half-sister but she dies after three years. Marries again.

has daughter in 1930.

Trip to Tirano in 1975. House vandalised after six months. Stays in Tirano.

## The next generation

### Mary Meotti

### Barney Molinari

### Arthur Molinari

### James Molinari

### Helen Molinari

### Jim Pianta

From Trove we can extract:

In April 1922 James Pianta was
[fined](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article82887541)
for selling milk under standard.

In June 1924 James Pianta was
[involved](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31239413)
in an incident at the trots:

>There were accidents in three of the events decided during the evening, but, fortunately, the consequences were not serious. In the Basswood Handicap Silver Dawn became entangled in his topples and Bobbie ran into him; Lady Eddington fell in the Melville Handicap, and caused J. N. Pianta (Brenda) to be dislodged from his spider; ND in the Canning Handicap Phyllis Roy came clown and caused a mix-up, in which the chief sufferers were Gala Water, William Whips, and Royal Robe.

In fact he was a keen owner and driver was prominent for a decade in the trotting results.
