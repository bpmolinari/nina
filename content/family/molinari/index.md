## Introduction

My paternal grandfather is Giovan' Domenico Molinari (1882-1959). He was born in Tirano, Sondrio, Italy and emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1902.
Three siblings (two brothers and a sister) migrated from Tirano, in Sondrio, to Perth in the first 15 years of the twentieth century. What was the context of them leaving at that time, and why Australia?

The family recorded history and oral history is rather weak. The sister died early (in 1941). The younger brother went back to Tirano in 1975. They didn't much write to one another, or at least didn't reply to letters.

## The Tirano Context ##

This is provided by 

Jacqueline Templeton, "From the Mountains to the Bush: Italian migrants write home from Australia, 1860-1962", University of Western Australia Press, 2003.

This is a study of migration from the area of Italy. It constituted the great majority of migtarion in the 1880-1914 time. The area was agricultural and poor. The population was small landholders and poor. Land was in short supply. There was a tradition of younger sons working outside the area either seasonally or for a number of years. Money was sent back regularly, of accumulated until return. This happened in Europe (Switzerland, France) where unskilled farm labouring jobs were available. To some extent this system was transferred to Australia.

The author has found access to a number of letters from the (single) sojourners in Austral back to Tirano. Many stories tell of isolation and loneliness. They tended to work together on small contacting arrangements, and the opportunities of interaction with the broader community were limited.

A broader story is told in the book "Sojourners", for the Chinese migration to Australia in the nineteenth century.

There is a considerable amount of Italian-Australian studies now available.  The journal
[Italian Historical Society](https://www.coasit.com.au/italian-historical-society/ihs-journal)
has a number of articles, and in fact lead me to find the Sondrio records.

## Bernardo Molinari (1842-1918) ##

Look at family tree. 
[molinari](BernardoMolinari.pdf)

{{< pdf src="BernardoMolinari.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" >}}

Bernardo (1842-1918) was married FOUR times. Wives and children:

1. Maria Beccaria (haven't found the marriage registro - records started in 1866)

- Domenico 1868 lived 6 days
- Bernardo 1869 lived 2 days
- unnamed girl 17 Dec 1871 "non e' vivo"

Maria died  24 December 1871 in Tirano (obviously from complications), aged 30

2. Marta Tudori (married 1873, age 25)

- Maria Domenica 24 Nov 1874 lived 6 days
- Domenica Marta 27 Feb 1876 lived 2 days

Marta died 20 Nov 1876 in Teglio, aged 38)

3. Maria Reghenzani (married 01 Mar 1878, age 33)

- Domenica 18 Sep 1878 died 2 Sep 1879
- Maria Domenica 23 Feb 1880  (married Giacom' Pianta)
- Giovan Domenico 16 Jan 1882 (grandfather Dom - note the name)
- Bernardo 3 Sep 1883 died 25 Apr 1886
- Rose Palmira 25 Apr 1885  Died 3 Sep 1886
- Bernardo 16 Nov 1886 "lived 10 minutes"
- Bernardo 26 Nov 1887 (Uncle Barney)

Maria died 22 Oct 1902 in Tirano, aged 56

4. Maria Caterina Rossi (married 6 Mar 1904, age 36)

No children and I can't see when she died. Bernardo was 62 at this stage.

None of his wives came from Tirano - God only knows how he found them and persuaded them to marry him.

He seems to have spent the time 1888-1901 (or thereabouts) in Australia.

- Domenico Molinari of Madonna di Tirano emigrated to Australia in 1888, leaving his wife and three children. The younger of two brothers, Bernardo, was 2 when his father left but nearly 14 when he returned twelve years later and immediately expected obedience. To Bernardo, his father was a usurper whose authority he refused to recognise and, as soon as he was able, he left permanently for Australia, following his brother who had already gone, perhaps for the same reasons. (Templeton, page 93, who attributes the information to a conversation with Bernardo's daughter Roma).

- The travel date is probably correct. There is a Bernardo Molinari ("workman, aged 32) on the [passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/4269E182-F96C-11E9-AE98-D719FDAA70E0?image=116
) of the Salier which 
[arrived in Melbourne](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6896982) on 03 August 1888.
The age given is wrong (he was 46) but there seems to have been no requirements to carry an identity document which could be checked. 
The baby Bernardo was not yet 1.

- He is still away in April 1901. On his daughter's marriage certificate (in Tirano) his address is recorded as "ignota in Australia" (unknown in Australia).

- He was back in Tirano when Maria died in October 1902.

No details of his stay in Australia have been found and no record of his return trip to Italy. There is a vague family story that this was his second trip to Australia. This can only be possible if he was back in Tirano by, say, 1867.


 

## Maria Reghenzani (1845-1902) ##


Look at family tree. 
[reghenzani](MariaReghenzani.pdf)

{{< pdf src="MariaReghenzani.pdf" width="100%" height="400px" >}}

Maria  was married THREE times. Husbands and children:

1. Giovanni D'Abbondi (haven't found the registro - records started in 1866)

No children in the period of the records. Giovanni died in 1870 aged 47.

2. Domenico Ferrari (married 1872, he was 51)

- Maria Giovanna 20 May 1873, Married Giovanni Molinari
- Caterina 25 Aug 1874, Married Andrea Ferrari

Domenico died 1 Feb 1875 aged 54.

3. Bernardo Molinari (see above)


Life was clearly cheap in Tirano. By my reckoning Bernardo had 12 children, of whom only three reached maturity. Maria had 9 children, of whom five reached maturity.

There were a large number of Molinaris and Piantas and Ferraris in Tirano, but almost none in the next communes Villa di Tirano and Teglio. Clearly it was a tribal way of life.

## The Migrant Generation

The three Molinari siblings migrated to Perth in close succession: Dom in 1900, Maria Domenina in 1907 and Bernardo in 1908. They left two half-sisters in Tirano (from their mother's earlier marriage). The second sister, Caterina Ferrari, had three children, of whom two also migrated to Perth: Eliza Ferrari in 1923 and Battista Del Torre in 1924. The first sister, Maria Giovanna Ferrari, stayed in Tirano and her family were the rather indistinct "Tirano relatives" of my chidhood. She had married Giovanni Molinari, so these relatives bore the Molinari surname (but from a different family).

### Domenico Molinari

For the first time, we have a photograph. This is Domenico at his wedding in 1911, aged 29.

{{< figure src="DomenicoGiacintaMolinari.jpeg" >}}

He migrated to Perth in 1900. Married in 1911. Then owned a hotel in Day Dawn, in 1918.

Then blacksmith in Cue. Gold possession. Retirement. My memories.

### Domenica Pianta (nee Molinari)

Married Giacomo Pianta in Tirano. He moved to Perth in 1902, leaving Domenica and son behind. Do not have a photo of Domenica, but one of the brothers in law.


Sad story. Did not come out until 19xx. They run a diary farm. Husband was seriuosly injured and committed to a nursing home. Commits suicide in 1941.

### Bernardo Molinari

Comes out in 1908. Works in New Norcia for eight years. Business man. Somewhat of an unofficial consul, facilitating Italian immigrants.

Marries the daughter of his half-sister but she dies after three years. Marries again.

has daughter in 1930.

Trip to Tirano in 1975. House vandalised after six months. Stays in Tirano.
