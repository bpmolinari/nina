## Cue, Day Dawn and the Cosmopolitan Hotel

### Overview

The sleepy state of Western Australia was transformed in the period 1880 to 1900 by a wave of
[gold rushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_gold_rushes).
In contradistinction to the earlier gold rushes in New South Wales and Victoria (1855-1870) the finds in WA were in the dry interior of the huge state, way beyond the settled areas.
All supplies and equipment had to be hauled hundreds of kilometres from the coastal towns  of Perth and Geraldton.
Initially this had to be done by horse and by camel, along bush tracks.
Through the 1890's railways were pushed to the main mining centres, greatly simplifying transport.

The [Murchison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_West_(Western_Australia)) Goldfield was declared in 1891, after discoveries of gold at
[Nannine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannine,_Western_Australia) in 1890.
This declaration meant that a Government Mining Warden was installed, and an elaborate scheme of mining leases was put in place (and enforced).

A group of prospectors including Tom Cue found gold in 1892, some 60 km south of Nannine and Tom travelled to Nannine to register their claim.
A townsite was gazetted in 1893 and named 
[Cue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue,_Western_Australia) after him.
This gazetting meant that a street layout was determined, blocks of land were sold by the Government, and land titles issued.
The great Australian preoccupation of buying and selling land could could now be indulged in.
Cue was the the location of a number of rich reefs, and intensive mining developed.
A railway from Mullewa to Cue, some 320 km, was completed in 1898.
At its heyday, in the decade 1900 to 1910, Cue had a population of around 10,000.
Mining activity was curtailed during the 1914-1918 war, and it did not recover after the war.
The population steadily declined, but Cue remained viable as a minor regional centre (current population 120).

Several mines were established some 8 km south of Cue, which resulted in a separate township being gazetted in March 1894, called Bundawadra.
By May 1894 it was renamed
[Day Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_Dawn,_Western_Australia), after the name given to the main reef.
The most successful mine, The Great Fingall, operated from 1898, and employed over 500 miners. At its heyday, also in the decade 1900-1910, the population of Day Dawn was 2500. 
In 1918 the mine closed, and being a one-mine town Day Dawn rapidly collapsed into that Australian icon, a [ghost town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_towns_of_the_Goldfields_of_Western_Australia). 
The only building remaining is the [Mine Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue,_Western_Australia#/media/File:Day_Dawn.jpg).

A collection of early maps of the WA goldfields is available [here](https://historicalgoldmaps.com.au/historical-gold-maps-of-the-wa-goldfields/).


### Day Dawn Notes

Day Dawn supported a local newspaper, *The Day Dawn Chronicle*, which was published from 1902 to 1909 (first once a week and then twice a week). Four pages per issue, price 3d.

This is somewhat surprising, because only 8 km away two newspapers were published in Cue:

*The Murchison Times and Day Dawn Gazette* (1894-1925)

*Murchison Advocate* (1898-1912)

There was an earlier newspaper, *The Murchison Miner* (1893-1894), which ran into libel problems. This is not available in the Trove database.

The Great Fingall mine was, for a while, one of the most successful mines in Australia. A 1906 [article](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article250962914) in the Day Dawn Chronicle pointed out that an original investor in the company had received a dividend return of 1000% over the eight years, as well as a share increase of 400%. The mine then employed over 700 workers (at an average wage of about 4 pounds per week).

There were a considerable number of Italians working in the Cue-Day Dawn area.

Some 75% of the underground miners on the Great Fingall were Italian,
[suspected](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article250953175) of slinging kickbacks to the overseers to get work.
This was regarded as being offensive by the Italians but not, apparently, by the non-Italian shift bosses.

The fuel for the mine operations was exclusively supplied by locally-cut timber. This was a [wood-line system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_railway_lines_of_Western_Australia) was based on light railways, moved as the timber in an area was cut out.
The timber getting was heavily dependent on Italians, working on a contract arrangement.
This was brutally hard work in an isolated environment, and the workers had little opportunity to improve their English language skills. The Great Fingall closed for a while in 1908 when the timber getters
[went on strike](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article250968754).

The same system operated, on a larger scale, out of Kalgoorlie. There was no coal supply in WA (the first coal mine at Collie did not open until 1927). The gold mining industry was said to be the biggest industry completely dependent on timber as a fuel, in the world.
Amazing for an arid environment.

The collapse of Day Dawn was sudden, and complete. From a 1924 newspaper article:

Sunday Times (Perth, WA : 1902 - 1954), Sunday 20 July 1924, page 12

> Day Dawn's Sunset

> Future Hopes and Possibilities. The Sadness of a Dying Field. By Quaker

> When the Great Fingall mine at Day Dawn ceased activities some six years ago that little mining centre was delivered a blow from which it has never recovered, nor is it at all likely that it will ever even partly recover as things are at present. For some little time prior to the actual closing of the mine it was more or less common knowledge that something was going
to happen, and a few of the knowing and thrifty members of the community proved their sagacity by selling their homes and seeking fresh fields and pastures new. But, alas, for the unfortunate ones - optimistic until the end - they hung on until the final word was given to stop work. What a blow! Then came the general exodus. Homes and lifelong collections, none of them the most handsome by any means, for such is not the miner's lot, were sacrificed. Houses were sold to dealers, who stripped them of their iron and marketable fittings, but in many cases leaving the framework. In less than a year a thriving little mining centre became a veritable "dead-end."

> We, where 60 head of stamps had merrily banged out the joyful news, with somewhat deafening glee, that the elusive "dwt" was being snatched from Mother Earth, were soon to start the work of devastation.
The magnificent machinery used in the work of production was soon to be the prey of the dismantlers. Within a few months engines and plants which cost thousands of pounds were sold for scrap iron, as it was impossible to obtain a price for them complete, the industry being on the decline and mining machinery not in demand.

> With the demolition of the mining plant and houses came the closing of
many of the numerous hotels and business places. No longer would one hear the singing of the Italian miners on Saturdays and pay-nights in the
old "Cosmopolitan" and "Commercial",
the old accordions and concertinas
would no longer wheeze out the happy
accompaniments to the midnight serenaders wending their way homewards to "ski-town." Now perhaps a few stray dogs or goats inhabit the
streets of the silent town, and nose among the rubbish heaps left to indicate where once so many happy times were spent, even if superseded by a "big head" when it was time to "pusha da truck" next day. No longer does an enthusiastic crowd congregate each Sunday afternoon at the old recreation ground to cheer the "Rovers" to victory over the "Fire Brigade" in the contest for football supremacy, and, more important still, no longer does the old yellow Ford (the mine car) travel to Cue each fortnight with the superintendent and accountant in it, with the usual two or three bars of gold. It is only a fleeting recollection which brings the "pay" back to the mine twice a month. Alas! It is a reality no longer.

> Such is the fate of one mining town. How brave and hopeful are the few who still struggle along making ends meet in the district, trusting in then own convictions that some day another Fingall will be found to reward their patience. May it be so!.

> To the individual uneducated in the customs, life, and, for that matter, the death of a mining district, it is no doubt hard to conceive that such a change can be brought about in such a short time; but when the fact is brought home that not very many years ago the Fingall mine employed several hundreds of men and at the time of closing upwards of 200, which represented those upon whom about 90 per cent of the population were dependent, the failure of a mining concern appears all the more appalling.

> The directors of the company, in delivering their ultimatum, said "the high cost of mining stores, the high
cost of wages, and the inefficient labor obtainable, through the number of miners enlisting for the war necessitating the employment of the unskilled," were the main factors which were
responsible for their drastic action, a truly deplorable combination of facts. The war-apparently the chief cause of it all- has ended, and we are gradually becoming restored to our equilibrium after its awful aftermath; but still we find that the mining activities in the Day Dawn district are still
in a state of stagnation. The district is dead. Surely there must be something in the locality which would warrant the investment of a little capital to seek it. It is hard to even make oneself try to believe there is only one Fingall in a 60-mile radius. It is incomprehensible even to a lay mind! So while the terrible possibilities of hardship and desolation on the Kalgoorlie goldfields are before us, let those who are in a position advocate for the sympathy and practical -help which the Cinderella field - the Murchison - deserves.

> In and around the Cue-Day Dawn district very many good gold producers to the water level mark have been known, and only the want of capital to install the plant necessary to mine below this level has prevented the testing of the reefs. This district is too far distant from the city and share markets to attract the speculator, when the Kalgoorlie district is so conveniently situated and offers so many attractions in the competition for the investors' affections; but let
us hope that the trusting few, struggling along, some 500-odd miles north of the city, may some day be rewarded by the investment of some of the available capital, which could prove
their judgement and reward their patience, to the aid of and in reviving a dying industry - gold mining.


### Hotels in Day Dawn

There were seven hotels in Day Dawn. A hotel was a nontrivial enterprise.

There was the owner of the building, who was also the title-holder of the block on which it was built. There may also have been a mortgage on the building and land.

There was the publican, the holder of the hotel and liquor licence issued by the Government. Without a liquor licence you ran a temperance hotel, and there was little money in that.

The owner and the publican were not necessarily the same person. You had to be a British subject to hold a hotel license, but perhaps this was not required of the owner. 

The Licensing Court met in Cue, every quarter.
The [report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233358632) of the March 1902 meting makes interesting reading.

### The Cosmopolitan Hotel

We have a photo of the hotel in 1918.
{{< figure src="CosmopolitanHotel1918.jpeg" >}}

The hotel was owned from 1901 until 1915 by a remarkable character named Pietro Ceruti (1867-1921), as described at one of his
[bankruptcy hearings](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26944119).
He arrived in Albany with his family, in December 1896. After an
[eventful](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article216689548)
three years in Coolgardie he moved to  Day Dawn. In May 1901 an
[application](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233339013)
is made to upgrade the license of the Cosmopolitan Hotel from that of a Wine and Beer Saloon to that of a Public House.
The building consists of

> two sitting rooms and fifteen bedrooms (exclusive of those
required by the family)

and is listed as being owned by Pietro. In August 1902 he and his family returned to Italy, leaving the hotel rented (at a claimed 14 pounds per week).

By October 1911 he was back in Perth, giving
[evidence](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76812385)
to a commission on miners' lung disease.
By September 1912 he is back at Day Dawn, successfully
[applying](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=14203)
for naturalisation. 
His stint as publican was unsuccessful, and by June 1913 the hotel lease (and publican's licence) was taken over by Bartolo Pozzi and Carlo Saligari.
By December 1914 they had gone broke (as explained in their
[bankruptcy hearing](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article80996854)).
The hotel then lost its licence, due to repairs being needed.
By March 1915 it was 
[open again](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233273742),
with a tricolour flag flying from its flagpole.
Its publican was one Urbain Martin, a Frenchman.
By later in the year he was selling up the complete contents of the hotel, notionally on the basis that he was a French Reservist and had been called up to serve in France.

The hotel was taken over (in late 1915 or early 1916) by my grandfather, Dominic, with ownership being a partnership with his brother Bernardo.
This lead to a bitter family dispute, described elsewhere.
The hotel was, according to family legend, quite profitable and was clearly still
[operating](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81390277)
in May 1919.
By the end of the year, however, the end was in sight.
In an advertisement addressed to *Station Owners and Others*, it was described

> as a going concern or for
removal. This is a well-built two-storey
building and contains approximately
15 tons corrugated iron.

The license lapsed in December 1919, and it disappears completely from
the records. One can only assume it was demolished.

In the same edition of the *Murchison Times and Day Dawn Gazette*, one Mrs. M. Gibson is shown to be an incurable optimist. She announces she has taken the lease of the Commercial Hotel in Day Dawn, and is soliciting patronage.

Pietro Ceruti is worth a postscript. His career to 1915 is summarised in an article entitled
[Snakes, Opium and Statues](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81170780)
that is simply impossible to summarise.
In November 1919 he was again
[bankrupt](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81933963).
In November 1920 he arrived back in Fremantle on the ship *Charon*, in possession of a brand-new Italian passport that was issued in Singapore, and only valid for a one-way trip to Australia. It was promptly
[confiscated](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=1329805)
on arrival. He died in 1921.
