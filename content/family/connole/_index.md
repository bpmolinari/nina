## Introduction

My maternal grandmother is Margaret Connole. We can identify her father, and her maternal grandparents. They all arrived in South Australia from Ireland, in the first years of that colony.

## Great-Great-Grandparent Generation

### Rose Higgins (1823-1851)

An important source for the Higgins story is a memoir *The History of Thomas and Ellen Higgins and Descendants 1805-1987*, written and self-published by Joyce Higgins. Joyce completed her work before the world of digitised resources. However it captures family stories. Anyone who has experienced Irish family stories, repeated word for word over several generations, will respect the details she reports until otherwise disproven.

Rose was the second child of Thomas and Ellen Higgins, from 
[Clonmore, County Carlow, Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonmore,_County_Carlow). She had an elder brother, Patrick.

The family emigrated to South Australia in July 1840. This was barely four years after the foundation of the colony in 1836. They arrived on the ship *William Nichol* on 7 July. A detailed 
[description](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:William_Nic(h)ol%2C_Arrived_7_Jul_1840)
of the trip is available. In particular, the
[passenger list](https://bound-for-south-australia.collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/1840WilliamNichol.htm)
has been transcribed.

It was a fast and uneventful trip for the time, and the grateful passengers signed a collective testimonial to the captain and to the surgeon. and published them as [advertisements](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27441639) in the *South Australian Register* of 18 July 1840. They had good cause to be grateful, as travel by sailing ship was risky. Leaving Adelaide on another voyage, in March 1843, the ship *William Nichol* was hit by a hurricane on the way to Bombay and dismasted, limped to Port Louis in Mauritius, hit a reef and was written off. The passengers and the mails to England
[survived](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27443600).

Joyce Higgins' memoir tells us:

>Since both Thomas and Patrick were agricultural labourers, they took up land at Morphett Vale, being Section 620 Hundred of Noarlunga. The property was in the Higgins family for 127 years, being sold in 1967.  
Thomas and Patrick helped to quarry the stone to build the first Catholic Church in South Australia, which opened on 4 January 1846. Previous to the opening of the church, Mass was held at the Higgins' homestead.

We have a 1859
[map](http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-1898076291) that shows the land division. It was on the USA model, of strict north-south and east-west alignment, with a farm being a square 30 chains on edge. This 90 acres was deemed to be all that a family could cultivate with the then technology. We have an even earlier
[1840 map](https://maps.collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/map890/i1568753a/map890_i1568753a_zmp.jpg). Section 620 had not yet been allocated, but sections further up the little creek (closer to Morphett Vale and Adelaide) had been.

The Higgins were not agricultural labourers. They must have had capital, presumably from selling a family farm back in County Carlow. The land in Morphett Vale would have cost them £90. Initial land sales were controlled, at a fixed rate of £1 per acre, and at that early stage were the primary source of income for the colonial government. They would have needed more capital for animals and equipment, for materials for the first house on the farm, and to support themselves until the farm produced something. If you did not have such capital, you worked for a wage. Colonies were short of labour, not of land.

Rose had a busy first year in Morphett Vale. By July 1841 she was eighteen, she had married Patrick Aherne and given birth to Ellen. We know Ellen's birthday reasonably well (January-February of 1841), so it looks at though she was pregnant when she arrived in the colony. Perhaps a shipboard romance. But we can't place Patrick on the ship's list. Passing strange. She had two further children, in 1844  and 1846. We know her husband died in 1847, and she is reported as dying in 1851 (though I cannot find any definitive record).

Her brother Patrick married in Morphett Vale and had nine children, creating an extensive dynasty in South Australia (carefully documented in Joyce Higgins's memoir). 

The *South Australian Register* 16 January 1856 tells us:
>DREADFUL ACCIDENT WITH A THRASHING-MACHINE.  
On Monday morning, Mr. Patrick Higgins a farmer of some standing at Morphett Vale, was engaged in feeding his own thrashing-machine at the Emu Inn, and inadvertently put his left hand too far down into the feeding-box. The drum of the machine caught his fingers, and drew in his arm, the flesh of which was instantly torn off as far as the elbow, and the bone beaten to pieces. The machine was immediately stopped, and the horses taken out, messages being at once dispatched upon them in different directions for surgeons. Dr. Montgomery, of Happy Valley, and Dr. Lane, of Noarlunga, quickly arrived, and the patient's arm was amputated about half-way between the elbow and the shoulder. Mr. Higgins is about forty-three years of age. He bore the operation exceedingly well, though no chloroform was used. He was removed shortly afterwards upon a stretcher to his own house, about two miles distant, and in the evening was reported to be going on favourably.

He died nine days later. The reporter got it wrong - he was thirty-three years old. The machine may well have been a [Ridley Stripper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridley_(inventor)) which was developed and manufactured in South Australia.


His widow died 40 years later. The 
*Southern Cross* of 21 February 1896 tells us
>Many old colonists will regret to hear of the death of Mrs. Mary Ellen Higgins, widow of the late Patrick Higgins, which sad event occurred at Morphett Vale on 12th inst. The deceased lady had been ailing for about a month, and at the time of her demise had attained the ripe old age of 75 years. Arriving in the colony by the ship Berman (Captain Bagot) in December 1840, she settled in Morphett Vale in March of the following year, and resided in the locality ever since. The deceased leaves two sons, three daughters and eleven grandchildren. One of her daughters is Mrs. H. Hill, of Yatala. The Rev. Father O'Donnell, of Willunga, was most assiduous in his attentions to the deceased during her illness, and was present at the funeral which took place last Saturday at the local cemetery, and was largely attended.

### Patrick Aherne (1811-1847)

The great majority of early immigrants to South Australia have been recorded (the early ships were chartered by Commissioners, and the passengers carefully recorded). Patrick Aherne is one of the exceptions - we do not know when he arrived or whence he came. The spelling of surnames had not standardised. Variations to   Aherne are *Ahearn*, *Hearn* and *Herren*.

He seems to have been a ratbag. 
The *South Australian Register* of 18 August 1847 [reported](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page4147771):
>Patrick Ahearn, labourer, was charged with a felonious assault upon Michael Murphy, on Saturday evening last, in Rundle-street.  
Frederick Beyer, surgeon, stated that he had been called upon to attend Murphy, and found him labouring under a complicated fracture of the scapula. He had also many other wounds about the head, but none of great importance. The patient was not in a fit state to come to court. The scapula was broken in several pieces. Should say that the wound was caused by a blow from a stick, but could not say what the wounds on the head were caused by. Murphy would not be able to appear before a fortnight.  
Christopher Whitford, labourer, stated that, on Saturday evening, be saw a man trying to get his bullocks and dray along the street, which was nearly impassable, from the number of drays then about. Saw two men strike each other with whip sticks, but they laid by these implements, and commenced with their fists. Lost sight of them for a few minutes, and afterwards saw Murphy amongst four or five men, from whom he made his escape, and drive his bullocks and dray towards North-terrace. Heard the prisoner say 'Where is the man that struck me?' when Murphy said he was the man. The prisoner then struck Murphy with what he considered a whip stick. Saw several persons follow Murphy across the street, and witness, making towards them, saying, 'Don't murder the man, whatever you do ;' and witness advised prisoner not to be fighting, when he said, 'We don't want such men as you here, for we are Radicals.' Murphy then came forward, and said, he had not the use of his arm. Saw no more of them until next morning, when he saw the prisoner, and said, 'That's the man that done the mischief last night,' and caused him to be taken into charge. Before they dispersed they shook hands and parted. Murphy appeared to be sober.  
Another witness was called who deposed to a conversation between Murphy and the prisoner upon the next day, when the former said he would bear a part of the expenses which would be incurred through his illness.  
His Worship said the charge was one not at present which appeared to him to be felonious, and he would remand the prisoner for a week, when, if Murphy was better, he could sue him for damages, or for a common assault . The case was then remanded for a fortnight, and his Worship consented to take bail for his appearance — one surety in £40.

The *South Australian Register* of 1 September 1847 [reported](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48545091):

>Patrick Ahearn, charged with feloniously assaulting Michael Murphy, was brought up on remand from the 15th instant.  
Murphy stated the complaint in full  
Mr Poulden, for the defence, made application to have the case dismissed, on the ground, that it was a common assault, to which his Worship agreed.  
Case dismissed accordingly.

Two weeks later he was dead. The *South Australian* of 14 September 1847
[reported](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71609384):
>An inquest was held to-day, at the "Kangaroo Hotel," Southern Road, on the body of Patrick Ahearn, late of Morphett Vale. It appeared from the evidence that he had been drinking at Mr McDonald's, of the "Forest Inn," and that after leaving that place, he had fallen down on the road and was suffocated. The verdict returned was, "Found Dead."

## Great-Grandparent Generation

### Austin Connole 1830-1888

Austin arrived in Port Adelaide in 1858. He is on the
[passenger list](AustinConnoleShip1858.jpg) of the ship *Sir Thomas Gresham*.
He is aged 24, and "Jno Baker Esq" paid £1 toward his fare, and presumably then took him on as a farm worker. This is probably
[John Baker](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/baker-john-2920). Austin is said to have come from County Clare, Ireland but we do not have any specific information about his background. No siblings came to Australia.

He married Ellen Aherne a year later, in
[Morphett Vale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale,_South_Australia).
They had twelve children.

He was a labourer, and is said to have worked on the roads. In 1888, at the age of 54, he committed suicide. A [report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47269677) in the *South Australian Register* tells us

>MORPHETT VALE, April 3.  
A man named Austin Connole, a labourer, was found dead to-day hanging from a tree in Mr. O'Sullivan's garden. An inquest will be held on Wednesday.

The [inquest](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47268064) tells us
>SUICIDE AT MORPHETT VALE.  
Mr. C. H. Myles. J.P., on Wednesday last, April 4, held an inquest at Morphett Vale upon the body of Austin Connole, which was the previous day found by some children, suspended to a tree near the township. The man, whose age was somewhat above 50 years, it appears had been for a short time before his death acting somewhat peculiarly, but had expressed no intention of destroying himself. The Jury's verdict stated that the deceased committed suicide by hanging himself whilst in a state of temporary insanity.

### Ellen Aherne 1841-1936

Ellen must have been possessed of a remarkable constitution. She was born in 1841 in Morphett Vale. She was orphaned at age 10. She married Austin Connole at age 18. By 1886 she had 12 children (9 survived), and two years later she was widowed (at the age of 47). She managed to bring up the children, and survived to the grand old age of 95.

When she was orphaned one presumes the Higgins family took her in. Her grandparents and her uncle were still alive (though he and his wife had nine children). Her two younger sisters disappear from the record. Joyce Higgins comments:
>As both parents died when the children were very young, we can only presume that the children were adopted out.

Perhaps Ellen was old enough to earn her keep, while her younger sisters were not. The Higgins were extremely strong Catholics. Perhaps adoption to a "good Catholic family" was seen as an acceptable alternative to keeping them in the family.

The [Adelaide Destitute Asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Destitute_Asylum) had been established by this time. There is a *Catherine Ahern* listed on page 2 of an 
[index list](https://www.archives.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/829772/GRG28_4_Register-of-Cases-of-Destitution_1849-1857_A-H.pdf)
of cases of destitution, along with the date 1855. Ellen's sister would have been nine years of aged by then. Maybe it is her (I have not been able to find the full record). There is a
[report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49776462) in the *South Australian Register* of 8 June 1858 of the Destitution Board that says in part
>MORPHETT VALE. Mr. Myles, Chairman of the District Council, recommended Sarah Patmore, with two children, deserted by her husband. Not entertained. Also, Ellen Higgins, whose husband died in the Hospital nine months ago. To be admitted into the Asylum.

Not our Ellen, I think.

An [article](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129270028) in the *News* of 14 March 1936 discusses surviving pioneers of South Australia. It says in part

>Among the other oldest pioneers in the records is Mrs. B. J. Currie, of Jeffcott street, North Adelaide, who arrived in the State in the ship Martin Luther in 1840. Those who were born here in that year include Mr. W. B. Hill, of Arthur street. South Plympton; Mrs. Ellen Williams, of North road. Nailsworth; and Mrs. E. Chaplin. Natives who were born in 1841 include Mr. Robert Perkins, of Ucolta; Mr. William Gregor, of Port Vincent; and Mrs. E. Connole, of Morphett Vale.

The *Chronicle* of 12 March 1936 records her death:

>CONNOLE.—On the 10th March. Ellen Connole, relict of Austin Connole, late of Morphett Vale, aged 95 years. Requiescat in pace.

She would then appear to have been born between 1 January and 9 March 1841.

		   
At the time of her husband's death, the nine children were aged between twenty-three (Mary) and two (Annie). Joyce Higgins's memoir comments:

>After their marriage Austin and Ellen lived in a small cottage near Christies Creek at Morphett Vale. Owing to his failing eyesight, Ellen used to help Austin with his work on the roads. After Austin's death Ellen went out to work, mainly doing sewing, to keep her younger children. Some of the elder children were in service away from home.

We have two photographs. The first is of Ellen in mourning dress, presumably after the death of Austin. 

{{< figure src="EllenConnole1920.jpeg"
           caption= "Ellen Connole in mourning dress. c 1888" >}}

The second is of Ellen with three of her children, somewhat later.
{{< figure src="RitaArthurMargaretEllenConnole1930.jpeg"
           caption= "Annie, Arthur, Maggie, Ellen Connole. c 1930" >}}

A final note. Her marriage record, at least as transcribed by Ancestry.com, has her as [Ellen Herren](EllenHerrenMarriage1859.pdf), as does the birth records for all her children (such as [John Connole](JohnConnoleBirth1860.pdf)).

## Grandparent Generation


This is the generation of my grandmother and her siblings. Of the ten who reached maturity, four moved to Bunbury WA. Of those, one went to the Boer War (and then on to England) and one went back to Morphett Vale. Of the others, one went to New Zealand, one to Albury and one to Melbourne. Only four died in South Australia.

For reference the following family tree shows all descendants of Austin Connole.

        width="100%" height="400px" >}}
Family tree: Austin Connole [(fullscreen)](AustinConnole.pdf)

### Mary Connole (1863-1903)

Married Phillip Millis in Adelaide in 1880, when still sixteen. Lived in Melbourne. Apparently no children.

### Augustine Connole (1865-1937)

Married Jane Stewart Collins (also born in Morphett Vale) in Bunbury, WA, in 1899. On the electoral roll for Fremantle, WA, for 1903 and 1906, as "teamster". Returned to South Australia about then. Joyce Higgins reports
>He was employed by the SA Railways as a fettler and station attendant.
They had six children.

### Rose Connole (1867-1896)

Married the splendidly named Edward Tom Navarino Roberts, who was born at sea on the *Navarino* en route to Australia in 1854. Rose had four daughters (the first of which seems to precede the arrival of Edward). Died aged 28. Edward remarried.

### John William Connole (1870-1952)

Married Emily Maria Daly in Glenelg, SA. Apparently lived in Broken Hill for a while and then settled in Albury, NSW. In the electoral roll as "labourer". They had seven children. Joyce Higgins comments:
>William settled in Albury where he worked as a carrier and Emily ran a boarding house. At one time she was a midwife in the district.

### Hubert (Hughie) Connole (1873-1946)

The electoral roll has him from 1910 to 1937 as living in
[Grass Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Valley,_Western_Australia),
as a "farm labourer" and "teamster". This is a small farming community just outside Northam. 1943 finds him in the 
["Sunset" Old Mens Home](https://inherit.dplh.wa.gov.au/public/inventory/printsinglerecord/69ee0b3b-9ed2-4ebd-a02f-47365d959720) in Perth. He died, a bachelor, in 1946.

We have a photo (shamelessly taken from Ancestry.com). It shows Jeremiah O'Driscoll, Emily O'Driscoll, Bob Davidson and Hughie Connole (Farm Manager), at "Shamrock Villa", Grass Valley, WA.

{{< figure src="JeremiahODriscollEmilyODriscollBobDavidsonHughieConnole.jpeg"
           caption= "Hughie Connole (right). 1921" >}}

Joyce Higgins comments:  
>He went to WA in the early 1900's and about 1920 went to Grass Valley to work on a farm for a Mr. O'Driscoll. After Mr. O'Driscoll's death (in 1926) he stayed on and managed the farm for Mrs. O'Driscoll, and taught her sons to work the farm. He stayed there until 1942. He was an above-average cricketer and expert spin bowler, and a true sportsman.

### John Sylvester (Jack) Connole (1876-1934)

He can justifiably called an adventurer. He moved from Morphett Vale to Bunbury, to the Boer War. He stayed in South Africa for five years and then moved to England. He served in the First World War as a Major. He died in England in 1934.

{{< figure src="JohnConnole1900.jpeg"
           caption= "John Connole. c 1900" >}}

The *Western Mail* of 12 May 1900 gives a
[full list](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33185728) of the Fourth WA Contingent, bound for the Boer War. It includes in the non-commissioned officers:

>60. John Connole, 24 years, born in South Australia, farmer, recently of
Bunbury. Served three years in South Australian Mounted Rifles and three years in Bunbury Rifles.

This would indicate that he moved to WA around 1898. The list specifies that many of the contingent had served in various colonial military forces. The various such groups in WA are
[described here](https://www.wamdl.com.au/WAMDL/index.php?title=Colonial_Forces).
That website also provides a copy of the
[Official Records of the Australian Miltary Contingents to the War in South Africa](https://www.wamdl.com.au/WAMDL/index.php?title=Official_Records_of_the_Australian_Military_Contingents_to_the_War_in_South_Africa).
From there we find

>The Contingent left on 8 May 1900, comprising 7 officers, 120 others with 132 horses. Three were killed; one officer promoted from the ranks; 3 officers and 35 others struck off in South Africa; 5 officers, 81 others returned to Australia (arriving in Albany on 20 July 1901).

Jack Connole was one of those who were "struck off". While this commonly indicates professional misconduct, I think in this case it simply meant that 38 of the 124 remaining simply decided to stay in South Africa. Having tasted adventure, why go back to an unexciting job in WA?

This
[record](JohnConnolePTC1901.jpg)
seems to indicate that he served (if only for three months) in the provisional Transvaal Constabulary.    Another
[record](JohnConnoleSAC1901.jpg)
indicates that he served with the South Africa Constabulary, discharged on 15 November 1901.

On 9 September 1903 he married Margaret Isabella Callaway (born in Devonshire, England in 1876). Remarkably we have the 
[marriage record](ConnoleCallawayMarriage1903.jpg)
and a 
[photograph](JohnConnoleMargaretCallaway1903.pdf)
(again shamelessly acquired from the web). Jack is an "agent", and Margaret a "spinster". They both reside at "Wilton House" (which
[still exists](https://www.wiltonguesthouses.co.za/) as an upmarket guest house).

On 20 February 1906 Margaret gave birth to a daughter. Tragically Margaret died six weeks later, of "puepural septicemia". We have the
[death record](MargaretCallawayDeath1906.jpg).

Sometime in the next year John took the infant back to England, to make contact with Margaret's family. In September 1907 he married Gertrude May Callaway in Plymouth, Devonshire. Gertrude was Margaret's younger sister! They had nine children.

John [served](https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/lifestory/920085) through the First World War. He joined the 2/4 Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, which [served in India](https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/164081-24th-duke-of-cornwalls-light-infantry/) (go to the last comment).

He died in Devonshire in 1934.

Joyce Higgins comments:
>John "Jack" was born in Morphett Vale. He worked as a farmer before going to WA. in 1900 Jack enlisted as a sergeant in the 4th Mounted Infantry for service in the Boer War. After the war Jack remained in South Africa for a year or so, having married Margaret Callaway, who died young leaving him with a young child. He took the child to England, to see her grandmother Callaway, and remained in England. After a brief spell as a farmer, he joined the duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry in 1914 and served in World War I until 1919.  
He practiced as an auctioneer and estate agent until his death in 1936. Jack was talented in music, playing several instruments. Of the nine children of his second marriage, eight served in World War II.

### Arthur Patrick Connole (1879-1957)

He married Anne Zeising in Wellington, NZ in 1910. Anne was born in Adelaide, so maybe they met in Adelaide before Arthur went to New Zealand, and Anne followed him there. We do not know when Arthur made the trip nor what motivated him to do so. They had six children. Anne died in Wellington in 1946, and Arthur died there in 1957.

Joyce Higgins comments:
>Arthur Connole was an electrician by trade in South Australia and went to New Zealand as a young man. In Wellington, he worked as a cable inspector for the City Council, and in the evenings he worked as a fireman in the theatres 9a different theatre each week). Their home was one of the five that was affected by the big fire in 1923. He became a tally clerk on the wharves after he retired.

He may have been an electrician in Adelaide but it seems his qualifications may not have been accepted in New Zealand. The Wellington papers record him working through a Technical College course in the period 1911-1971.

We have a photograph of Arthur and his younger sister Annie.

{{< figure src="ArthurConnoleAnnieConnole1930.jpeg"
           caption= "Arthur Connole and his sister Annie" >}}


### Margaret Connole (1881-1956)

Maggie moved to Bunbury around 1900. Her older brothers Augustine, Hughie and Jack were already in Bunbury (or at least WA) by then. Family legend has it that in Bunbury she worked as a domestic for the Stokes family, who were
[local worthies](https://inherit.dplh.wa.gov.au/public/inventory/printsinglerecord/19db5594-9e80-4e13-b7ce-49e595904a55). The Stokes family provided de facto family support at the time of her wedding to Les in 1908.

She was a staunch Catholic while Les was at best a lapsed Congregationalist. The children were educated in Catholic schools and they saw themselves as good Catholics to the end.

From my mother's telling, Maggie did not have an easy life. As described elsewhere, Les was an enthusiastic but not particularly successful businessman. Most of his enterprises involved hard work for Maggie, and she was the one who kept the family together.

She died of heart failure, presumably the result of undiagnosed and untreatable high blood pressure. She was in hospital for the last six months of her life, slowly fading.

My memory of her is that of a kindly but rather reserved old lady, somewhat like this photograph.

{{< figure src="MargaretConnole1945.jpeg"
           caption= "Margaret Atkins. c 1945" >}}


### Francis Connole (1883-1906)

The *Advertiser* of 4 May 1906 reported.

> MOTOR FATALITY.  
The inquest as to the cause of the death of Frank Connole, who was killed by a motor accident early on Tuesday morning, midway between Willunga and Morphett Vale, was opened on Tuesday night at the Court house, before Mr. T. McMurtie, and a jury. After formal evidence had been given, the inquest was adjourned until 2 p.m. on Wednesday and it was concluded that night. Connole was chauffeur to Dr. C. Newland, of Morphett Vale, and he was found dead on Tuesday morning, his body lying underneath the overturned motor. At the enquiry Mounted Constable Wells watched the proceedings on behalf of the police.  
A large number of witnesses were examined. The evidence showed that Con-nole, accompanied by John O'Neil and John Fitzgerald, left Morphett Vale in the car, which had been procured from Dr. Newland's residence, at about 11 o'clock on Monday night to find a horse of which O'Neil had charge and which was the property of Aldam Bros., of Willunga. The horse broke the bridle, and bolted from the Emu Hotel, where the men had been drinking together. They travelled to MacLaren Vale, and called at the Bellevue Hotel, and had a few drinks. Thence they proceeded to Willunga, called at the Alma Hotel, and searched Aldam Bros.' paddock. Then they started on the return journey. At the Cross roads on Goss' Hill the car ran off the main road and capsized, the off front wheel being completely smashed. Frank Connole, according to the medical evidence, was killed instantaneously. O'Neil was severely injured, but Fitzgerald escaped with a shaking. When the accident occurred O'Neil and Fitzgerald cleared out, leaving Connole crushed under the car. They did not inform any one of the accident.  
The jury returned a verdict that the deceased, Frank Connole, came to his death by the accidental upsetting of a motor car on the main road near Willunga on May 1, 1906, and they added the following rider:  
"We wish the coroner severely to censure the witnesses, O'Neil and Fitzgerald, for the cowardly and unmanly way in which they left the deceased after the accident. "  
Fitzgerald was called before the jury and censured by the coroner but O'Neil was not present as he is still confined to his bed suffering from injuries received as a result of the accident. Fitzgerald as previously stated, escaped without any injury. Connole's widowed mother lives at Morphett Vale, to which place the body was taken yesterday for interment.

His gravestone was erected by members and friends of the Morphett Vale Cricket Club.

### Annie Teresa Connole (1886-1963)

Annie married Percival Bond in Adelaide in 1908. Joyce Higgins comments:
>Percival was one of the Bonds who were builders at Tralee.

They had two girls, Doris and Rita. Annie and Maggie, being the two youngest girls, kept in close contact. Doris and Rita, of my mother's many Connole cousins, were the ones she maintained contact with.

Percival Bond committed suicide in 1931.
The *Advertiser and Register* of 31 July 1931 reported:

>Percival John Bond (48), builder, of Cromer Parade, Millswood, was found lying dead on the floor of his workshop at 11 o'clock yesterday morning. There was a bullet wound in the right temple, and a revolver lying at the side of the body. Constable Homes, of Goodwood, reported the matter to the Coroner, who decided that an inquest was unnecessary.

The Great Depression may well have had a drastic effect on his business.
A [copy](PercivalBondEnquiry1931.pdf) of the Coroner's enquiry is available.
