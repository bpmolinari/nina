## Introduction

My paternal grandmother is Giacinta Dall'Acqua(1983-1973). She was born in Selva di Cadore, Belluno, Italy and emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1911. When I was growing up we seemed to have no family stories as to her background, and I only have one photo of her.

In 2024 I found the Italian state births, deaths and marriages records for the Belluno province online (via Ancestry.com). Working through those records has allowed us to fill in much of her story.


## The Selva di Cadore Context

Strictly, [Selva di Cadore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selva_di_Cadore) is a small commune in the province of Belluno, in the north=east of Italy, against the border with Austria. It is also the name of the main town. The commune had a population of about 1000 when my grandmother lived there - it is now half that.

[Cadore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadore) is a identified region in the Dolomites. before 1902 the commune seems to have benn named Selva Bellunese, and before that simply Selva.

| name | occupation | meaning |
| ------ | ------- | -- |
| Vincenzo | agricoltore | farmer |
| Maria Zuliani | | |
| Lorenzo | agricoltore | farmer |
| Paolina Torre | villica | tenant farmer |
| Romano | legnajuolo | woodcutter |
| Maria Zanicolo | villica | tenant farmer |
| Manueto | offellieri | confectioner |
| Gettrude Buogo | contadina | farmer |
| Riccardo | bracciante| farm labourer |
| Carolina Scardozan| casalinga | housewife |

The distinction between agricoltore, villico, and contadino somewhat escapes me at the moment.
 
Giacinta and her brother Riccardo arrived at Port Fremantle on 10 March 1911,  on the North German Lloyd ship Barbarossa. She married Dominico Molinari on 25 September 1911, in St Mary's Cathedral in the centre of Perth. Presumably Dom had made some money in his ten years in WA.

Riccardo is on the passenger list for the North German Lloyd ship Bremen leaving Fremantle on xx, bound for Sydney. Whether he stayed in Sydney, or went directly back to Italy is not clear.

## The Cousin: Gerardo Callegari

It is convenient to show the family tree for Giacinta's grandfather, Giacomo Torre.

Clearly, Giacinta and Gerardo Callegari(1886-1937) were first cousins. Gerado and his wife Oliva Dell'Andrea emigrated to WA, arriving at Port Fremantle on the North German Lloyd ship Bremen on 08 November 1908. Presumably, their presence in WA had a considerable bearing on Giacinta's decision to emigrate some two years later.

Gerardo and Oliva had a large family - I have shown nine children in the family tree. As a child I was aware of several of the that generation, but did not appreciate that they were genuine second cousins from Selva di Cadore.
