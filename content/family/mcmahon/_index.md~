We have a family memoir to help us:

- Trish Meldrum, "Maynooth to Melbourne - Descendants of Matthew Luke Mahon and Margaret Duffy of Maynooth", 2011 (privately published).

This is a very detailed and comprehensive work, and incorporates a great deal of primary sources and family stories. 

## Great-Great-Grandparent Generation

### Luke Mahon (1802-1866)

Thanks to the Trish Meldrum memoir, we know quite a lot about Luke and his wife.

The family tree of his descendants is quiet impressive.

Family tree: Luke Mahon [(fullscreen)](LukeMcMahon.pdf)

Luke Mahon was born and resided all his life in the town of
[Maynooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynooth), which is 24 km west of central Dublin. In 1795, Maynooth was selected to be the site of St Patrick's college, established to train the Catholic clergy. This institution, commonly known as
[Maynooth College](https://seminary.maynoothcollege.ie/about/a-brief-history)
was by 1850 the largest seminary in the world. The student body fluctuated between five and six hundred. This was clearly a good place to be a tailor, as there was a large pool of customers for standard outfits for seminarians and for newly-ordained priests. It was the Oxford and Cambridge culture of "town and gown", writ small.

The original 
[Maynooth](https://www.townlands.ie/kildare/north-salt/laraghbryan/maynooth/maynooth/) is a townland, in the Electoral Division of Maynooth, in the Civil Parish of Laraghbryan, in the Barony of North Salt, in the County of Kildare.

For birth, death and marriage records, we have civil records that start in 1865. Before that Catholic parishes provide baptism and marriage records.

>About Ireland, Catholic Parish Registers, 1655-1915  
The Ireland Catholic Parish Registers is the single most important collection needed to trace your Roman Catholic ancestors in Ireland in the 1800’s. According to the 1861 census, almost 78 percent of the population was Catholic; by 1891, this had risen to 89 percent. This collection is made up of baptism, marriage and death records from over 1,000 Catholic parishes across the whole of the island of Ireland - both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as it is known as today. While baptism and marriage records make up the majority of the collection, death records can be found primarily for parishes in the northern regions.  
Approximately 94 percent of Catholic parishes are included in this collection, though not all registers from these parishes are available. For more information, visit the National Library of Ireland website at registers.nli.ie.  
It is worth noting that, while the Church of Ireland was the established state church from 1536 to 1870, an overwhelming amount of the Irish population remained Roman Catholic throughout this period. Irish Catholic Emancipation was secured under the Roman Catholic Relief Act in 1829, lifting legal restrictions that were previously in place against all Catholics. By this time, Penal Laws were also lifted, which had forbidden the Catholic Church to maintain parish registers.  
Catholic Emancipation brought more freedom to record vital events within the Catholic Church. As such, the bulk of the records in this collection date from the late 1820’s onwards. Where some earlier registers exist back to the 1650’s, they are known to cover the more prosperous and anglicised eastern counties of Ireland.  
The records are written in either English or Latin. For help understanding the Latin entries please see our helpful glossary of common terms.  
The indexes to this collection have been created from approximately 367,000 digital images made available for free by The National Library of Ireland. In keeping with the ethos of The National Library of Ireland efforts, the images in this collection are also available for free on this website. The index has been created and the images published by Ancestry under the National Library of Ireland's Terms of Use of Material.

We have their
[marriage record](MahonDuffyMarriage1825.jpg). The direct link into the National  Library of Ireland site is
[here](https://registers.nli.ie/registers/vtls000633432?locale=en#page/118/mode/1up).
The record is the second from the top on the left-hand page. It is handwritten in church Latin:

>Augusti 1825  
24 Luca Mahon in matrim. Duxit  
Margaritam Duffy testibus Jacoba  
Green & Anna Coffey

I take this to translate to

> On 24 August 1825 Luke Mahon joined in matrimony with Margaret Duffy. Witnesses: James Green and Anne Coffey.

Their first child Matthew was born a year later. We have his
[baptism record](MatthewMahonBaptism1826.jpg). It is the third-last on the right-hand page. Again, handwritten in church Latin, and somewhat cryptic.

>AD 1826. Julii.  
23 Mathous Luco Mahon & Margarita Duffy Conj.  
SS. Michaeli Carpenter & Margarita Anthony

I take this to translate to

> Baptised on 23 July 1826: Matthew. Parents Luke Mahon and Margaret Duffy (married). Sponsors: Michael Carpenter and Margaret Anthony.

Somewhat amazingly, the entire has been subjected to character recognition (or human transcription) and fully indexed. Searching this index on Ancestry.com gave hits to the baptism records of all nine children. I needed to scroll the marriage images to find the marriage record, however.

Trish Meldrum's memoir provides a transcription of the Mahon family headstone in Laraghbryan cemetery. This gives us dates for the death of Luke and his wife Margaret, and tells us that four of the nine children died young. In fact, Margaret died several days after the baptism of the last child. We assume that the child did not long survive.

Of the four surviving children, the oldest, Matthew, stayed in Maynooth and carried on the trade (tailoring) of the father. The other three emigrated to Victoria.


### Robert Givan (1790-1878)

The record allows us to reconstruct quite a detailed story about Robert Givan and his wife Jane Patterson.

The family tree of his descendants is quite impressive.

{{< pdf src="RobertGivan.pdf"
        width="100%" height="400px" >}}
Family tree: Robert Givan [(fullscreen)](RobertGivan.pdf)

A [discussion board entry](https://irelandxo.com/ireland-xo/history-and-genealogy/ancestor-database/james-given-1801)
surmises that the Givans were originally 
[Ulster Plantation Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people). 

Robert Givan came from the
townland of
[Gortnacreagh](https://www.townlands.ie/tyrone/strabane-upper/cappagh-upper-strabane-portion/mountjoy-forest-west/gortnacreagh/), in the Electoral Division of Mountjoy, in the Civil parish of Cappach, in the County of Tyrone. This is just outside the hamlet of Mountjoy, itself about 10km north of the town of Omagh. He married Jane Patterson in 1836. Secondary sources give a precise date, but I have been unable to verify it. They had four children.

The family emigrated to Victoria in 1859. We have the
[passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B0DE06F-F96C-11E9-AE98-4BA0F0071BF0?image=230#) for the ship *Greyhound*. They are half-way down the second page, as

| name | age | calling |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| Robt. Given | 55 | labourer |
| Jane   " |   40  | wife |
| Anne   " |   20  | spinster |
| John   " |  18  | labourer |
| Mary   " |   11 | child |
| Jane   " |    8 | child |

They are all "Irish", and are contracted to land at Melbourne. Robert's real age was 68 and Jane's was 48 (according to information on their headstone in Melbourne Cemetery).

The *Argus* of 10 January 1859 reported

>January 9  
Greyhound, Black Ball ship, 1,412 tons, John Davies, from Liverpool October 9. Passengers—cabin : Misses Young (2), Miss Hatchell, Sir E. Poole, Bart. ; Messrs. Smith, Burke, J. Farmer, Miller, Goode, Beggs, Reddeth ; and 310 in the intermediate and steerage. Mackay, Baines, and Co., agents.

It is clear that the family were strong Presbyterians. Trish Meldrum provides the following letter of introduction:

>This is to certify that Mr Robert Givan and family are respectable members of the Presbyterian Congregation of Cross Roads near Omagh in connexion with the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland and our heartfelt prayers and wishes are for their own and their family's prosperity spiritual and temporal in the land of their adoption, and may Providence preserve and convey them in health and in safety to the place of their destination.  
Dated at Cross Roads near Omagh this 1st October 1858.  
John Hamilton.

The family lived in South Yarra. Rate books give us the following information:

| date | Occupier | Address | Occupation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1864 | Givan Robert | Caroline St | Gardener |
| 1868 | Givan Robert | Davis St | Gentleman |
| 1869 | Givan Robert | Davis St | Labourer |
| 1870 | Givan Robert | Davis St | Gardener |
| 1871 | Givan Robert | Davis St | Gentleman |

Robert rented the first property, but is listed as the owner of the second property. It was a 6 room wooden house, with a slate roof. It was apparently called *MountJoy Cottage*, after their home town in Ireland. A confirmation of the first address is confirmed by the following report in the
*Telegraph, St Kilda, Prahran and South Yarra Guardian* of 6 August 1864:

>Robert Givan was charged with allowing his goat to wander in Caroline-street on the 30th ult. Defendant denied the ownership of the goat. Constable Rogers stated the daughter of the defendant had sent a boy to claim the goat as the defendant's property. Case postponed till Monday next, for the production of the daughter. 

South Yarra borders the 
[Royal Botanical Gardens Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Gardens_Victoria). The site was chosen in 1846, and were well underway in the 1860s. Perhaps Robert Givan worked there as a gardener. I take that the occupation of "gentleman" meant that he was no longer working and was living, presumably, on his investments.

His wife Jane died in 1862. Robert would have brought up the two younger girls, who were barely teenagers when Jane died. His children married in 1865, 1867, 1870 and 1881, and presumably lived at home until they married. Robert himself died in 1878, at the remarkable age of 88.

## Great-GrandParent Generation

### Matthew Mahon (1826-1904)

Matthew followed the tailoring trade of his father, and lived and worked in Maynooth his whole life. He married Mary Jacob in 1868. They had six children, one boy and then five girls. Three girls died very young in 1876, and a fourth girl died in 1882, aged ten. There must have been some childhood disease that was common to these tragic deaths.

We have the 1901 census
[record](https://nationalarchives.ie/collections/search-the-census/census-record/?census_year=1901&surname__icontains=mahon&firstname__icontains=luke&county=Kildare&sex=M&id=6845867).
Matthew is aged 74, his wife Mary is aged 61, and son Luke (aged 30) lives with them. Luke is carrying on the family trade, of Merchant Tailor.


Luke McMahon married Mary Ann Colclough in 1908. He says he is 38, but 39 might be more accurate. He didn't rush into marriage. Mary Ann says she is 25.

We have the 1911 Census
[record](https://nationalarchives.ie/collections/search-the-census/census-record/?census_year=1901&surname__icontains=mahon&firstname__icontains=teresa&county=Dublin&age__gte=16&age__lte=26&sex=F&id=5146259).
They have been married for 3 years, but he is now 40 and Mary is now 35. The Irish were perhaps a little flexible when stating their ages.

They seemed to have a single child, Imelda Mary, in 1914. With her the long line of McMahon tailors in Maynooth came to an end.
She seems to have married in 1939, and the family moved to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. They had six children, though only the oldest is shown in the family tree. The Maynooth connection was over.

In 1901 the surviving daughter Teresa seems to be working in Dublin, if
[this census record](https://nationalarchives.ie/collections/search-the-census/census-record/?census_year=1901&surname__icontains=mahon&firstname__icontains=teresa&county=Dublin&age__gte=16&age__lte=26&sex=F&id=5146259) is appropriate.
She does not appear in the 1911 census under her maiden name. I have not found any marriage record, or any death record.

### Patrick McMahon (1834-1913)

Patrick emigrated first, in 1861. He arrived in Melbourne on the *Green Jacket*, on 27 March 1861. In the 
[passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B19C758-F96C-11E9-AE98-83A363F01077?image=159#) he is "Patrick Mahon", is Irish, a "labourer", and states his age as 26.

he seems to have dasappeared from the record, apart from a cryptic death notice in
the *Age* of 12 February 1913:

>M'MAHON. On the 8th February, at the residence of his sister, Mrs. M. Sullivan, 13 Alfred Crescent, North Fitzroy, Patrick M'Mahon. Interred privately.

He appears to have lived as an Irish bachelor.
His death certificate says he is a "tailor", which is likely enough coming as he does from a family of tailors. There is one "Patrick McMahon" in the Melbourne ratebooks, but his occupation is consistently listed as "labourer", so I have judged it is not our Patrick McMahon. Maybe it is, and he preferred not to follow the tailoring trade.

his age details are inconsistent. By my reckong he was 



### Sarah McMahon (1832-1903)

Sarah, Margaret and John emigrated together. They arrived in Melbourne on the *Southern Ocean*, on 18 February 1865. The
[passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B2BA1B4-F96C-11E9-AE98-EF0B184FC7D3?image=161#)
shows them on the same ticket, giving their ages as 26, 23 and 16. Sarah would seem to be more like 33, while the others seem correct.

The *Age* of 11 February 1865 reported

>Queenscliff, 10th February.  
The ship Southern Ocean, 93 days from Liverpool, has been detained in quarantine. She has 330 passengers on board. Thirteen deaths are reported during the voyage of fever. The ship is reported very dirty. 

In the event, the ship was released from quarantine, and the *Age* 
[editorialised](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article155029895) mightily against the fact.

Age (Melbourne, Vic. : 1854 - 1954), Thursday 23 February 1865, page 1

>The introduction of that virulent disease, typhus fever, into the colony by the ship Golden Empire is now a fact established beyond all doubt, and has led to some correspondence between Dr. Macadam,
the health officer, and the local health officer at Hotham relative to the fever cases in that district, by which it appears clearly that sick persons were allowed to land from that vessel, and that the disease had spread in con-sequence. Reports from various parts of the country, where passengers from the Golden Empire have gone to, have come down to Melbourne, which show that the seeds of disease were widely disseminated amongst her living freight, as in many instances that insidious disorder had broken out in a violent form. Since then the ship Southern Ocean, from Liverpool, arrived in the Bay, having fever prevalent amongst her passengers, and was very properly detained until Saturday last in quarantine. The Great Britain arrived in Hobson's Bay on the 17th, and, having had a case of small-pox on board at an early period of her passage, was detained in quarantine until it was discovered that she was perfectly clean
and had no sign of infections disease on board. It is to be hoped that the precautions which have been adopted will prevent a recurrence of a similar infliction to that with which we have been visited, and from the dire effects of which we have so narrowly escaped, and that such measures will be taken as will render all similar negligence as that displayed a short time since impossible.

The *Argus* of 2 November 1916 reported

>KIERNAN.—On the 1st November, at his residence,
"Maynooth," Alfred crescent, North Fitzroy, Thomas, the dearly beloved husband of the late Sarah Kiernan, and beloved father of William, Margaret, Mary, Sarah, Thomas, and Christopher
Kiernan.

[thomas kiernan will](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/EB1D973C-F54E-11E9-AE98-A1BF2D406C38?image=2#)



It is interesting to note that he was described as a "marksman", that is, he signed with his mark. He must have had a very limited education in county Kildare.


The *Argus* of 19 January 1948 reported

>KIERNAN. On January 15, Margaret
Kiernan, 15 Alfred crescent, North Fitzroy, beloved daughter of the late Thomas and Sarah, and loved sister of William (deceased), Mary, Sarah (Mrs. Bolingbroke), Thomas, and Chris (deceased). R.I.P. (Interred privately, Melbourne Cemetery, January 16.)


William Luke. In the 1936 Electoral Roll, he and Margaret Agatha are residing at 19 Rockbeare Grove, Ivanhoe. He is a "carpenter".

### Margaret McMahon (1841-1931)

Margaret emigrated from Ireland in 1865, with her brothers Patrick and John, and her sister Sarah. She married William Sullivan in 1883. They had one child, Daniel, who died aged 8 months in 1885.

William Sullivan was 15 years older than Margaret, and had been married before. He had emigrated from Ireland in 1852 with his mother and two siblings. He married Anne Briscoe in 1861. Anne died in 1865, leaving him with two sons (John and Eugene). He died in 1901.
The *Argus* of 21 January 1901 reported
>SULLIVAN. On the 19th January, at his residence, 72 Alexandra-parade, Fitzroy, William, the dearly beloved husband of Margaret Sullivan, and father of John and Eugene Sullivan, R.I.P.

We have his
[will](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/295FB593-F539-11E9-AE98-35EC1C8BBD79?image=1#).
He left the considerable sum of 8500, He left a property portfolio, including the "General Gordon Hotel" in Brunswick Road, Fitzroy, split carefully between his wife and his sons. In the probate documentation he is described as "William Sullivan, Gent". I take this to mean that he didn't carry on a business or trade, but lived on his investments.

Margaret's bachelor brother Patrick came to live with her after her husband died. Patrick died in 1913 and Margaret died in 1931 at the age of 90.


### John McMahon (1846-1918)


### Ann Givan (1838-1923)


[annyoungwill](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/2975ED57-F1F0-11E9-AE98-0DC19532719A?image=22#)

The *Argus* of 2 June 1923 reported
>YOUNG. On the 31st May, at Mountjoy, 312 St.
George's road, North Fitzroy, Ann, widow of the late T. P. Young, aged 85 years. (Private interment.)

### John Givan (1840-1905)

The *Herald* of 26 May 1881 reported

>Sittings in Equity
(Before his Honor Judge Molesworth). GIVAN v. GIVAN.  
Sometime ago John Givan, the husband of Mrs Belinda Givan, licensee of the Glasgow Arms Hotel, Elizabeth street, was restrained by his Honor Mr Justice Higinbotham, in Chambers, from interfering with the business of his wife.
The application in Chambers was made by Mr Lawes, and it was urged by the learned counsel that Mrs Givan had purchased the business with her own money, and carried it on in her own name ever since. After the case had been fully argued by Mr Lawes, for the wife, and Mr Worthington for the husband, his honor Mr Justice Higinbotham made an order to restrain the husband from interfering with his wife's business or appropriating any of her property. The costs of the application amounted to L47, and they were given against the husband, and an order of attachment was granted on the non payment of costs.  
Givan was arrested on Monday last, and was to-day presented by the sheriff before the court, to be 'turned over' for contempt. Mr Lawes appeared to support the attachment. The prisoner was not represented. It appeared from the writ of attachment that the prisoner was ordered to be brought before the court on Thursday, the 26th of June, or the day on which the Equity Court sat, after the attachment was granted. Mr Lawes contended that the date was merely surplusage, as the writ really provided that the prisoner should be presented at the next Equity Court day after the arrest. His Honor asked the prisoner what he had to say. Tho prisoner replied that he objected to the date. His Honor said that he (the prisoner) seemed to be aware of the mistake as to date. He would order him to be turned over without prejudice to his making any definite application he desired. The prisoner was then removed by a warder.

The *Geelong Advertiser* of 4 November 1884 reported

>MATRIMONIAL SQUABBLES.  
At the Police Court yesterday morning, Belinda Givan proceeded against her husband John Givan, landlord of the Black Bull Hotel, to show cause why he should not be bound over to keep the peace towards her, and also for having assaulted her. Mr M'Cormick appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr Whyte for the defendant.  
The plaintiff deposed that her name was Belinda Louisa Givan. On Tuesday, the 28th ult., she returned to the hotel about four o'clock in the afternoon, having been out purchasing cigarettes which she intended to use to relieve her asthma. Her husband met her as she entered, and struck her on the arm, jaw, and cheek. She said ." You're a coward," and he replied that he would always assault her, and added "I'll murder you yet." On the 30th ult. she again went to the hotel, having had to leave it on account of her husband's violence, and when she got inside he struck her and shoved her against the door. The barmaid, who was present, said to her "You're a drunken old faggot," and her husband, saying "I'll do for you," caught hold of her by the shoulder, and pushed her roughly. She had been staying out of the house since that day. The previous case brought by her was settled out of court without her consent. She was afraid of her life, and she was not actuated by malice in bringing her husband before the court. In answer to Mr Whyte, she stated that she laid the information on the 28th ult, as she was afraid of her life. She went to the hotel on the follow ing day to get some of her clothing and her boots, and mastered up sufficient courage to
stay there as she had heard that things had 1 been taken away from it. She sat up all night in the barmaid's room, dressed, and went away in the morning before her husband got up. She had tea with the defendant on the 29th ult, and poured out her own tea. For a long time past she always lifted the windows of her room when she slept at the hotel, so as to he able to call for assistance from the street. She did not keep a revolver. There was a small pistol in her chest of drawers, hut she did not even know how to load it, and her husband broke open the drawers in order to get possession of it. She knew two girls employed at the hotel, named Wilson and Bristowe. She never said to Wilson, " I'll blow your brains out. I'll dash you down the stairs, and your clothes after you, By God ! I'll do for you yet." She did not pick up a whisky bottle and attempt to assault Wilson. She was not
drunk on the 30th or 31st ult. She had never said " I don't want to get Givan in gaol, but I want him to lose his license, I'd swear anything against him to deprive him of his license." John Davison, auctioneer, deposed that he saw Mrs Givan on the 28th ult, and she complained to him that her husband had assaulted her. She was not drunk, and he had never seen her intoxicated. She was the most punctual rentpayer that he ever had in the house. Her arm and face were bruised when she called on him. Eliza le Judge deposed that she was a married woman, hut was separated from her husband. She had lived at the Black Bull Hotel, on and off, for about six months as a general servant. In consequence of certain things she had seen and spoken about Givan had told her that she " saw too much," and that she had no business to interfere with him or his wife. She had seen the defendant knock Mrs Givan down and kick her, and had seen bruises all over her body. This closed the plaintiffs case, and Mr Whyte then stated that his client had
been sent to gaol on a former occasion on the evidence of the plaintiff, and that she after-wards became conscience-smitten and became bondswoman for his release. Finding that she eonld not manage the hotel herself she had the license transferred to her husband, and she now wished to deprive him of it, She lived privately by herself, but went in and out of the hotel and interfered with the servants and her husband at her " own sweet will." He called the following evidence :- Annie Wilson, barmaid, deposed that on the 28th ult. she was in the hotel when Mrs Givan called there, and she did not witness any assault. Mrs Givan abused her husband in an "awful" way, but he did not attempt to strike her. On the following day Mrs Givan had tea at the hotel, and laid the table herself. On the Thursday night, when she left the hotel ten minutes before midnight, she was very drunk. The witness swore that Mrs Givan had used the threats mentioned by Mr Whyte to her and had menaced her with a whisky bottle, which the defendant, however, wrested from her. The plaintiff had frequently called her a "strumpet" and other low names. On the 31st ult. she ordered her (witness) out of the hotel The girl Bristowe deposed that she entered the defendant's service on the 28th nit. as barmaid and pianist. She came from Mel-bourne for the purpose. She had heard Mrs Givan's evidence, but it was untrue. Givan had not ill treated his wife while she was there, but Mrs Givan bad abused him and the girl Wilson, and had accused her (witness) of pocketing the money taken in the bar. By Givan's orders she had put the money in her pocket to prevent Mrs Givan taking it. A young man who was called as a witness, deposed that he was in the Black Bull Hotel on the 30th ult., and heard Mrs Givan abusing her husband. He saw her poke her finger in Givan's eye, and the latter called her by her christian name and asked ber to desist. Givan did not attempt to strike her. He was not in the hotel on the 28th ult. This closed the case for the defence, and Mr M'Cormick then mentioned that Mrs Givan had complained to Constable Croacher (who had just entered the court) on the 28th ult. that her husband had assaulted her. With the permission of the bench he put the constable in the witness box, but Croacher stated that Mrs Givan was mistaken, as she had not spoken to him on the day named. He believed she had made some complaint to Constable Morris. The magistrates dismissed the case without costs. Mr Whyte then intimated that a summons for assault, issued against Mrs Givan by the girl Wilson, would be withdrawn, as he deemed it unnecessary to proceed with it.

The *Geelong Advertiser* of 9 December 1884 reported

>The Black Bull Hotel.  
The application of Mr John Givan for a renewal of his license for the above hotel was opposed by Mr Supt. Toohey. Mr T. N. Whyte appeared for the applicant, and Mr Pincott for the owner of the property.  
The police stated that the objection was that Mr Givan was unfit to hold a license, that he was of bad fame, and that the conduct at his house created a disturbance in the neighbourhood. Constable Thos Gleeson (plain clothes police), of Melbourne, deposed that in 1878 and 1879 Mrs Givan kept the Glasgow Arms hotel, in Elizabeth street. During that time Mr Givan stopped at the hotel, and was often before the court for assaulting his wife and threatening her life. People of questionable character were allowed to visit the hotel. Mrs Givan afterwards took the Town Hall hotel in Melbourne, and the disturbances between Mrs Givan and her husband were worse than at the Glasgow Arms. Witness was of opinion that the applicant was not a fit person to hold the license. To Mr Whyte—It was in 1878 or 1879 that he saw Givan drunk. The license for the Glasgow Arms was transferred to Mrs Givan. There were two prosecutions against Givan for assaulting his wife, one was withdrawn, and the other dismissed.  
George Mercer, stationer of Malop street, deposed that he objected to the licence being allowed to Givan, for
the house was badly conducted, especially on the occasion of the Fire Brigades Demonstration.  
Constable M'Greal deposed that several complaints had been made regarding the disturbances at Givan s hotel. On the 24th July, 1883, Givan was bound over for 12 mouths to keep the peace for assaulting his wife. On the 4th November last, Givan was charged with beating his wife, and the case was dismissed. To Mr Whyte—The magistrates did not retire to consider their decision on the 4th November. Sergeant Swale deposed that many complaints were made about the disorderly conduct at the hotel. There was no furni-ture in the house on the 19th November. Mr Pincott on behalf of the owner of the property, objected to Givan getting the license as he was a trespasser. The property was in course of sale to Mrs Givan, but it had not been completed, and Mr Givan was now a tres-passer. Mr John Davison said that the sale of the property to Mrs Givan, who was the recognised tenant, had not been completed. On the 27th November Mrs Givan paid the rent, and left the house, and he (wit-ness) considered the applicant a wrongdoer. Mr Whyte submitted that there was nothing at all in Constable Gleeson's evidence, for all he had said was of a general character, and was on the reports of other people. There was not a word of ill repute against Givan personally.  
Mr Givan deposed that for 10 years he was a warder in the Melbourne, Pentridge, and Ararat gaols. He was never drunk in his life. The two cases against him in Melbourne regarding his wife were dismissed. He had no notice of ejectment from the hotel, and he had not been asked for the rent. He had ordered £80 worth of furniture from Melbourne. He had been publicly thanked by Mr Supt Winch in Melbourne for assisting the police.  
The Police Magistrate said that the bench were unanimous in refusing the license to the applicant with £1 1s costs against Givan.

On the other hand, the next case was unsuccessful.

>The Fire Brigade Hotel.  
The police objected to a license being given to Mrs Belinda O'Callaghan for the above hotel, on the ground of gambling and card playing by boys being allowed, and for serving drink after hours. John Duggan deposed that he played cards at the hotel on the night of the 1st November. There were other lads playing cards at the hotel, but not gambling. A young man named Redden was murdered at 1.30 a.m., that was half-an-hour after they had drinks at the
hotel.  
The bench did not think that the evidence was sufficient to support the objection, and they decided to grant the license.

The *Geelong Advertiser* of 17 September 1885 reported

>DEATH.  
Givan. On the 15th September, at her residence, Kardinia-street, Belinda Louisa, aged 42 years, the beloved wife of John Givan.


The *Geelong Advertiser* of 16 November 1883 reported

>An application was made to the magistrates at the Police Court yesterday morning by Mr Whyte, the well known solicitor, for the release of Mr Givan, husband of the landlady of the Black Bull Hotel, in Malop street. On the 24th July last Mr Givan was bound in two sureties of £50 each to keep the peace towards his wife for a period of twelve months. In the absence of the necessary sureties he was sent to gaol, in which place he has been kept ever since. Mrs Givan concluded that she had sufficiently punished the man who had sworn to be her friend and protector, and yesterday morning she stated that Mrs M'Cauley, of Melbourne, and herself were willing to become sureties for the prisoner. Under the circumstances the application was granted by the bench.
