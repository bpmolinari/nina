## Introduction

My maternal grandfather is Leslie William Atkins. Of *his* four grandparents, three arrived in Australia as free settlers from England. The fourth, Mary Ann Murtagh, was born in Sydney in 1821 to parents who were both transported convicts from Ireland.

Family tree: Lesley William Atkins [(fullscreen)](LesleyWilliamAtkins.pdf)

## Great-Great Grandparent Generation

### Charles Orlando Atkins (1827-1905)

Charles Orlando Atkins was married to Eliza Hannah Roberts on 29 January 1850, in Hobart Town, Tasmania. We have no record of him before that. He and Elisa had 12 children, of whom 8 reached maturity. He died in Hobart on 5 October 1905.

A death notice in *The Mercury* of 6 October 1905 tells us

{{< figure src="COAtkinsDeath1905.png"
            >}}

(There is a typo in the notice.) He "died in his 79th year", which means that he was born between 6 October 1826 and 4 October 1827. His 
[burial record](CharlesOrlandoAtkinsBurial1905.pdf)
tells us that he was born in England. We know no more about where he came from, nor of his coming. Ship registers are incomplete for free settlers to Hobart at that time.

He seems to use his full name wherever possible, so perhaps *Orlando* has some significance to him. A patron, perhaps. It is not a common English first name.

We have a photograph, from about 1894. There was an
[International Exhibition](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-23/hobarts-grand-exhibition-building-stood-for-only-three-years/10232028)
in Hobart in 1894-1895. A season pass cost one guinea, and required a photograph. These have survived.

{{< figure src="CharlesOrlandoAtkins1894.jpg"
           caption= "Charles Orlando Atkins. 1894" >}}

At his [marriage](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD37-1-9/RGD37-1-9P229)
his occupation is a *solicitor's clerk*.  At his
[burial](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/AF35-1-2/AF35-1-2P146)
he is a *law stationer*. At other times, he is a bookseller, a stationer, a newspaper printer, and an accountant.

Charles seems to have taken his religion seriously. He and Eliza were
[married](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD37-1-9/RGD37-1-9P229) in the
[Brisbane Street Independent Chapel](https://www.churchesoftasmania.com/2022/04/no-1081-hobart-brisbane-street.html).
by the Reverend Frederick Miller. He was still Independent at his burial.
(Here an Independent Church means a
[Congregational Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism)).
After Eliza died in 1877 he is said to have given up business and taken to his religion. He took temperance seriously, and is said to have been threatened with libel by publicans of the town.

In 1923 the *Critic* published a series of articles relating old Hobart. The
[article](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article172047393) of 17 March 1923 included the following:

>The bookshop and stationery establishment of Charles Orlando Atkins was next to O'Reilly's. Mr. Atkins possessed high commercial ability, and after he left business devoted his attention to clerical pursuits. One of his sons is a very old civil servant, with a meritorious record, and another son has been for many years connected with the printing of a temperance paper known as the "People's Friend."

The first-mentioned son is Charles Richard Atkins, the second is Edwin Orlando Atkins.

### Eliza Hannah Roberts (1831-1877)

Eliza 
[arrived](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/MB2-39-1-1/MB2-39-1-1P155)
in Hobart (at age 1) in 1832 on the ship *Thomas Laurie* with her parents and her younger brother Richard (who was born on the journey).

The record is not easy to follow. There are two ships recorded on the page - we want the second. There is a list of cabin passengers, and a list of steerage passengers - we want the latter. The Roberts are the second last on the list "Mr and Mrs Roberts and 2 children". Note that servants and children are counted but not named. Perhaps Charles Orlando arrived this way, as an indentured solicitor's clerk.

The arrival is 
[recorded](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article233613175)
in *The Tasmanian* of 16 November 1832. They are only interested in naming the the cabin passengers.

Eliza was 19 when she married. She and Charles Orlando seem to have had 12 children, of whom 8 reached maturity. She died quite early, at the age of 46. Her
[death certificate](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD35-1-9/RGD35-1-9P69) says she died of "asthma", and "congestion of lungs".

Eliza was born in
[Spitalfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitalfields), now an area in London but in 1831 a parish in Middlesex. Her father, Richard Lewis Roberts as born in
[Selattyn, Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selattyn_and_Gobowen) and her mother Hannah Pearson was born in
[Shoreditch, London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreditch).
They were married in Spitalfields. They arrived in Hobart, as free settlers, in 1832. This is only two years after such immigration to Tasmania was allowed.

Richard Roberts was a well-known builder in Hobart, and took on such projects as the Hobart Hospital. He died in Hobart in 1853. His
[death certificate](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD35-1-4p47j2k)
says he was 50 years of age (close enough) and the person reporting the death was his son-in-law, the trusty Charles Orlando. He was buried in the graveyard of the Congregational Church, Main Road, Hobart. So perhaps church attendance was the link between Charles Atkins and Eliza Roberts.
Hannah Roberts died 20 years later, and her
[death certificate](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD35-1-42/RGD35-1-42P16) nominated "congestion of liver".

Eliza was the oldest of six siblings, five of which reached maturity.

In order to show the full range of partners and siblings we need another family tree:

Charles Orlando Atkins (descendants) [(fullscreen)](CharlesOrlandoAtkins.pdf)

### Alfred Henry Atkins (1856-1932)

Alfred was the fourth of the eight surviving Atkins siblings. He was born in Hobart in December 1856, Eliza's fifth pregnancy in just under seven years.

One wonders what education they had. The
[education system](https://www.utas.edu.au/tasmanian-companion/biogs/E000320b.htm)
in Tasmania in the nineteenth century was poor. Compulsory education was not introduced until 1868 (it was compulsory but not free), and an education Department was not set up until 1885. Maybe the Atkins children went to a church school. 

Alfred seems to have been the only one to have left Tasmania. He is in Melbourne by 1880 (*The Age*, 31 May 1880, page 2)

>The following cases have been admitted to the Melbourne Hospital : — On the 29 th inst. Alfred Atkins, aged 24, residing at Hoddle-street, Richmond, suffering from an injury to the hip, which he received from a fall. He was repairing the roof of the Colonial Bank Hotel last Saturday when he fell a distance of 25 feet. 

For most of his life he seems to have been a waiter. In 1903 a
[report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article201387767) has him as the chief waiter at 
[Hosie's Hotel](https://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00725b.htm)
at the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth Street in the city of Melbourne.

He is the first person in this chapter of whom we have a family memory. He was my mother's grandfather, and she remembered him visiting Bunbury in his retirement. She said he was a dapper little man, very particular with his appearance.

The *South Western Times* of 21 December 1920 reported that

> Mr. Alf. Atkins, father of Les, the genial proprietor of the Bunbury baths, arrived recently from the Eastern States and will remain in Bunbury for some months. He is a remarkably athletic old gentleman and can show many of the budding swimmers a few points. He has been approached with regard to starting a class for non-swimmers. 

He was 64 at this time, and his wife had died some seven years before.

In the end he seems to have stayed over six years (*South Western Times*, 14 April 1927):

>The many friends of Mr. A. H. "Dad" Atkins, who left for Melbourne (Vic.) on the Katoomba for the purpose of undergoing an optical operation, will be pleased to learn that he is progressing favourably.

The *Williamstown Chronicle* of 22 October 1932 gave him a short obituary:

>A. H. ATKINS. A well-known resident of 45 Cecil street, in the person of Mr. Alfred Henry Atkins, died on Tuesday morning at his residence, after a brief illness. Born at Hobart, Tasmania, 74 years ago, deceased had resided locally for about 40 years. The funeral, largely attended, took place on Wednesday afternoon, leaving his residence for interment in the local cemetery. Ernest W. Jackson was the undertaker, and the Rev. J. Walker held a house service and officiated at the cemetery.

Brief Notes on his siblings:

- Charles Richard Atkins (1851-1940). A distinguished
[civil servant](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24704912). Married Mary Sealy in 1879. Six children, who all stayed in Tasmania.

- Edwin Orlando Atkins (1852-1930). Seems to have been a bachelor. His
[will](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/AD960-1-55/AD960-1-55-18437_1)
divides his estate between his two sisters, Florence and Edith Elinor.
Publisher of the monthly temperance broadsheet *Peoples Friend*. Sadly, this has not been digitised.

- Eliza Jane Atkins (1855-1934). [Married](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/RGD37-1-46/RGD37-1-46P139) Richard George Burn, three children. [Died 1930](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Record/NamesIndex/2037364) in the Mental Diseases Hospital, New Norfolk. Richard Burn seems to have remarried in 1902. Maybe Eliza Jane was mentally ill after her last child in 1895.

- Ada Atkins (1861-1923). [Spinster](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Digital/AF35-1-3/AF35-1-3P133J2K). Address: 8 Patrick Street, Hobart.

- Florence Atkins (1862-1948). Spinster. [death notice](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27772934). The last of the generation.

- George Herbert Atkins (1865-1916). Married late (age 41). One child (Beryl Joyce), who seems to have looked after her maiden aunts. Died at age 49.

- Edith Elinor Atkins (1867-1942). Spinster. [death notice](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25917578).

## Grandparent Generation

Of the four siblings in this generation, three moved to 
[Bunbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunbury,_Western_Australia),
and two (George and Leslie) stayed. Because of the role the town has in this part of our story, some
[Bunbury Notes](bunbury)
are provided as a separate page.

### George Arthur Atkins (1881-1958)

George Arthur was born in
[Carlton](https://www.victorianplaces.com.au/carlton), an inner suburb of Melbourne, in 1881. He married Abigail May (Dolly) Braund in Bunbury, WA, in 1903. He and Dolly lived in Bunbury all their lives, George dying in 1958 and Dolly in 1971. They had *16* children, of whom 13 reached maturity.

I have one photograph, showing 12 of the children.

{{< figure src="GeorgeAtkinsFamily.jpeg"
           caption= "George and Dolly Atkins and family. c 1930" >}}

An [article](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article252965479)
in the *South Western Times* of 27 July 1944 in informative. It shows a photograph of the 10 girls in the family, with the caption:
> Back Row (left to right): Betty, Maud (Mrs. H. Gardiner, Kellerberrin), Hazel (Mrs. Proud, Perth), Winnie (Mrs. F. Mills, Bunbury), Nancy (Mrs. Colin McDougall, Perth). Front Row: May (Mrs. Tonkin, Fremantle), Isabel, Alice (Mrs. B. Brady, Cue), Pauline, Dorothy (Mrs. Pat Molloy, Bunbury).

It tells us

>A FINE FAMILY. The ten daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Atkins, of Moore street, Bunbury, and two sons, Gunner Tom of the A.I.F., and Keith (Fremantle), complete the family. Another son George, well remembered in Bunbury, was accidentally killed some years ago, and three girls died in infancy. Mrs. Atkins, then May Braund, arrived in Bunbury in 1895; five years later George arrived, and in 1903 were married, and have lived at their present address ever since. "Geordie" Atkins is one of our best-known residents. He claims to be the original dance band leader introducing ragtime to the local lads and was in great demand at all social entertainments. Mrs. Atkins finds relaxation amongst her flowers, being the holder of many horticultural trophies, including three silver medals for "Yates" best collection of cut flowers. She should have a gold medal for the collection depicted above. All of the seven sons-in-law are either in the A.I.F. or R.A.A.F., son Tom in the A.I.F., and Dad George did his two years in the Garrison. Congratulations and best wishes to a fine Australian family.

Both George and Dolly were buried as Congregational (the same as old Charles Orlando). So maybe they met through the church. An
[obituary](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article212736536) for Dolly's father (Robert Ascot Braund) records that the family moved from Victoria to Bunbury in 1896.

The electoral rolls tell us that from 1903 George is described a a "labourer", and from 1916 through to his retirement as a "carter". They apparently moved into 2 Moore Street on their marriage, and never moved again.

He is best known as being a popular musician at local dances, balls and social gatherings (easily tracked through
[Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/)). At times, he is listed as *George Atkins Jazz Band*. A little far from New Orleans, perhaps. He is said to be "a demon on the drums, and "a master on the piano". He must have had some musical training, and considerable musical aptitude. He was never a professional musician (Bunbury was too small for that). But it clearly provided extra income for their large family.

The *South Western Times* of 18 November 1948 tells us
>Following the hearing of charges of stealing and receiving against an old age pensioner and his son at Bunbury Court on Monday, both were placed on £10 bonds to be of good behaviour for six months: in default one month's imprisonment.  
Keith Henry Atkins, (20), carpenter's labourer, of Moore Street, Bunbury, pleaded guilty to having stolen a washbasin and fittings, valued at about £4, the property of William Mapleton Brown. His father, George Henry Atkins, (67), old age pensioner, of the same address, was found guilty of receiving the washbasin. 

The [report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article253143449)
tells us how a plain-clothes detective cracked the case.

Rather surprisingly, I do not have have a memory of George or Dolly. I was 14 at the time he died, and had lived in Bunbury for most of that time. The two families, of brothers in the same town, did not seem to interact much. Mum made mention of her many cousins, but only regularly saw one or two.

Someone once mentioned that Aunt Dolly must have been overwhelmed by housework. Mum said: "On the contrary. Once the oldest girls reached 12 or so, they did all the work. Aunt Dolly sat in the corner, reading penny dreadfuls." I think the girls escaped the household as soon as they could.


### Ernest Charles Atkins (1883-1963)

Every family has the occasional ratbag, and Ernest Charles certainly qualifies as one for this generation.

The *Argus* of 10 December 1909 
[reported](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article253143449):

>At the City Police Court yesterday a young man named Ernest Charles Atkins  was charged with having as a servant, stolen a gross and a half boxes of pills, valued at £12, the property of his employers Rocke, Tompsitt and Co, wholesale druggists Flinders street. Francis Selby, 24 years of age was charged with having aided and abetted Atkins in the theft of the pills, and Henry Pethers 35 years of age was charged with having feloniously received the said pills knowing them to have been stolen.

Not the brightest, to steal directly from your employer. They all pleaded guilty. Ernest got three months. The Police Gazette reported his release from Pentridge.

{{< figure src="ErnestCharlesAtkinsRelease1909.png"
           caption= "Release from Pentridge" >}}

He seems to have been released in time for Christmas, serving only about two weeks.

In 1939 his long-suffering wife successfully divorces him, on grounds of desertion. The
[divorce petition](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/23BF01F3-F37E-11E9-AE98-7B7D2AD9DD2C?image=1#)
does not make pleasant reading.

Surprisingly, he marries again that year. He and his second wife are buried in the Woden Cemetery, in Canberra.

### Leslie William Atkins (1885-1977)

Leslie William Atkins (Les to his family) was born in Carlton, Melbourne in 1885. He moved to Bunbury in about 1903. He married Margaret Connole (herself a recent arrival from South Australia) in 1908. They lived almost all their life in Bunbury. Margaret died in 1956. Les's eyesight failed and he moved to Braille Home for Aged, Victoria Park. He died in 1977, aged 92.

{{< figure src="MargaretLesAtkins1908.jpeg"
           caption= "Marriage. Margaret Connole and Leslie Atkins. 1908" >}}

In Victoria, schooling was compulsory to the age of 15, and most children left school at that age. Les would have been no different. Later, he sometimes stated his occupation as "carpenter". It is not clear that he served an apprenticeship on that trade. I remember him telling me that as a boy he sold papers on the steps of 
[Flinders Street Railway Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Street_railway_station).

We can extract the following from the electoral rolls:
- He was certainly in Bunbury by 1906, staying with his brother George in Moore Street, and stating his occupation as "labourer". 
- By 1910, he is married, and he and Margaret live in Spencer Street. He is a "railway employee".
- In 1915 a [newspaper report](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article157544916) has them living in Karri Street. In fact, my mother was born there later that year.
- In 1916 they live in Beach Road, and he is a "carpenter".
- By 1922 they live at the Bunbury Baths, and he is a "baths lessee".
- By 1925 they live at White Road, and he is a "lumper". From a 
[list of occupations](https://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php): "a labourer employed to load and unload vessels in port; a dock-hand; a longshoreman; a stevedore". In Bunbury when I was a child, all wharf workers were called lumpers. Initially they had handled (lumped) bags of wheat.
- Later in 1925 they live at Rocky Point Tearooms, and he is again a "carpenter".
- In 1931 they are at Beach Avenue, Scarborough, and he is a "caterer".
- By 1937 they are at 23 Wittenoom Street, Bunbury, and he is a "dealer".
- In 1958 he is at 59 Stockley Road (Margaret died several years earlier).
- In 1963 he is at 14 Sunbury road, Victoria Park, and he is "retired".

We can look at Les's entrepreneurial career in more detail.

The *Southern Times* of 28 January 1911 reported:
>Mr. Les Atkins, accompanied by Mrs. Atkins, left Bunbury by yesterday morning's train for Adelaide, where both their parents reside, and where they intend to remain. Mr. Atkins was well known and very popular in Bunbury football circles, whilst his wife has been one of the best workers in the local Roman Catholic circles.

In the event they didn't stay. Family legend has it that Les couldn't find suitable work. 

His first enterprise involved taking the lease of the Bunbury Municipal Baths for the period 1919-1925. The *South Western Times* of 23 December 1919 reported:

> The Baths Opened. — Mr. Les Atkins has now taken over the Bunbury Baths and same will be open from today for public bathing. Bathing costumes, towels, etc., are procurable at the baths and within a few days everything will be in first rate order. Mr. Atkins now has men engaged in cleaning out the baths in a thorough manner, and promises that it will be made inviting to the large number of visitors and swimmers.

The baths had been constructed by the Bunbury Municipal Council to provide a safe environment for swimmers. It was part of a policy to make Bunbury an attractive holiday environment. The lessee paid a rent to the Council, and undertook to run and maintain the facilities such as changing sheds. The usage fees accrued to the lessee - there was a clear incentive for the lessee to increase patronage. The associated tearooms were run by the lessee, again a clear incentive to increase patronage. It was very much a seasonal business. Very busy on a sunny summer's day, but minimal on a typical winter Tuesday.

The local papers report various efforts by Les to drum up business. He installed a open-air dance floor, and ran dance nights in summer. Brother George's jazz band provided the music. It was a family enterprise. Family legend has it that Margaret ran the tearooms seven days a week. The children were too young to provide much help. Maybe that was why father Alfred arrived in December 1920, in time to help with the summer season. He stayed until April 1927 - his help would have been welcome.

The second enterprise involved taking the 
lease of the Rocky Point Tearooms for the period 1924-1929.
The *South Western Times* of 29 November 1924 reported

>Rocky Point Tea Rooms. — With the arrival of summer weather and the extensive patronage of the beach by bathers, the Rocky Point Tea Rooms are being opened to-day for the season by Mr. Les. Atkins. Every provision will be made for visitors and the wants of picnic parties will be specially catered for.

The tearooms (and associated five-room dwelling) had been built in 1920 by a local businessman Mr. H. Powers on land leased from the Council at the end of Wellington Street. This street ran from the center of town about 1 km directly west towards the ocean, and terminated where it hit the sandhills. Directly past the sandhills was a long basalt outcrop running north-south. This outcrop terminated about 100m to the south, after which there was a wide sandy beach that ran as far as the eye could see. 

It seems that over that summer, the family ran both businesses. It looks like Les ran the Baths, and Margaret ran the Rocky Point tearooms. The following report 
(*Mirror* of 10 January 1925) clearly indicates that the business was associated with Margaret (referred to in the style of the times as "Mrs. Les Atkins").

>A COSY CORNER. Since our Council has given so much attention to the back beach, a pleasant afternoon can be spent at Rocky Point Tea Rooms without unduly overtaxing the energy of those who prefer surf bathing. Mrs. Les Atkins, so popular at the baths for five years with visitors from Collie, Bridgetown, and other centres, has decided to install private bathing boxes, a jazz floor for visitors who enjoy open-air dancing, and make the handy-to-town rooms a fashionable summer resort. Anybody who is anybody in Bunbury now flocks to the popular rooms, where new management is making a long-looked-for change.

By the end of the year, Les seems to have reestablished himself as "mine host".
The *South Western Times* of 31 December 1925 reported
>Dancing at Rocky Point. Dancing at Rocky Point palais de dance is rapidly being recognised as the most enjoyable of summer evening pastimes in Bunbury, and since the opening of the season on Wednesday night, the congenial lessee of Rocky Point tea-rooms (Mr. Les. Atkins) has been a very busy man indeed. He is to be congratulated on his enterprise in catering for the wishes of the holiday public, and also on the success which has so far attended his efforts 

While clearly very busy in summer, the tearooms were clearly active all year round. The local papers report how various groups (such as the Surf Club) would hold meetings at the tearooms, and it operated as a small reception center for social gatherings such as farewell parties. 

The *South Western Times* of 5 March 1925 reported:
>A Surprise. — Mr. Les Atkins, having worked a night shift, was resting on the bed at his residence, Rocky Point, on Tuesday, when he was startled by a crash. A lump of basalt, weighing 15 lbs. smashed a hole through the roof and splintered the ceiling, but fortunately two boards stopped its further progress. The jagged lump of rock remained suspended immediately over the bed. It was a "fragment" dislodged by a shot fired in the course of operations at the quarry.

Maybe Les was working as a lumper. With the summer season over, the family might have needed a cash flow.
There was a quarry working the basalt at Rocky Point. The crushed basalt was used for road works through the town. The quarry works ceased soon after. Clearly it was too close to the town, and apparently the crushing equipment was obsolete. The quarry excavation was still there when I was a child, though filled with drifting sand.

A letter to the editor (*South Western Times*, 6 December 1926) indicates the local concern about sharks.

>"TINY" AND THE SHARKS. (To the Editor.)  
Sir, — There is no doubt that "Tiny" Brown has been a good Samaritan to bathers in Bunbury. Whenever there is a report that a shark has been seen "Tiny" is off home to get his gear. I remember one year at the baths someone said that they saw a shark outside the fence; "Tiny" was there that night with his lines, and it was not long before he had two hungry looking brutes, one 10 ft. long and the other 8 ft. 6 in. Last year while fishing on the big rock at the back beach I saw a shark swimming about. I sent word to "Tiny" and that night he had it. Yesterday two sharks were seen; "Tiny" was sent for, and now they are to be seen on the beach. One 9 ft. 8 in. and the other 8 ft . Well, Sir, I think "Tiny" Brown is deserving of some consideration for the good work he is doing, and it is up to us to "put in" to enable him to get good gear, plenty of it, and a little for himself. While on the beach last night I was approached to start this fund. The following gentlemen have responded: Mr. Fred Roberts 10/-, Les Atkins 5/-, M. Elliot 2/6, Mr. Skewes 2/6. Mr. Johnson 2/6, Mr. Abberly 2/6, Mr. Brittain 5/-, Dean Edwards 2/6, Mr. Hunter 2/6, Tom Prentice 2/6. Mr. Foreman 2/6, Mr. Sherlock 2/-, Harry Phillips 2/-, Mr. Jenour 2/6, Mr. Woods (Rose Hotel), 10/-; Mr. Thomas 2/-, H. Walker 2 Mr. Doust 1/-, collected 4/6.  
Yours, etc. LES ATKINS.


The third enterprise involved Les constructing a tearooms and boarding house on a freehold land on the edge of splendid beach at Scarborough (in the northeast of Perth). A [notice](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76042379) in the Perth *Mirror*, 12 July 1930, tells us:

>TEAROOMS AT SCARBOROUGH. Mr. Les Atkins, who was for six years lessee of the Bunbury Baths and for five years lessee of a tearooms and bathing sheds at the Back Beach, Bunbury, intends erecting shortly a tearooms at Scarborough.

It was essentially the first business in Scarborough catering to the beach trade. In the two previous businesses involved Les a lessee. The capital requirements had been relatively modest. Les had now clearly accumulated enough capital to construct premises from scratch. Les (and the family) ran this business from late 1930 until 1934.

A family photo shows the tearooms soon after construction. The tearooms front an unmade road (The Esplanade) and face sandhills and then the beach. We see three youths (with surfboards) making their way down a path to the beach.

{{< figure src="AtkinsTeaRoomsRockyPoint.jpeg"
           caption= "Atkins Tea Rooms. Scarborough. 1930" >}}

By 1932 the road has become a sealed promenade, and an advertisement outlines the services available.

{{< figure src="AtkinsScarborough1932.png"
           caption= "Atkins Scarborough Establishment. 1932" >}}
		   
It was very much a family business. Margaret clearly provided the "three-course lunches" and "grills supplied at a moment's notice", and ran the accommodation (meals provided).
Ivy was a somewhat free spirit and was a good jazz pianist. She provided a jazz band (Ivy Atkins Jazz Orchestra) for Saturday night and Sunday night dances at the tearooms in summer. Murray and Lily (my mother) had left school and were impressed into the business. With the Depression hitting, there were not many other options, anyway.

Murray was killed in a traffic accident in November 1932. Family legend has it that Margaret took the death of her eldest son very badly, and her enthusiasm for the beach business enterprise faded.  The business was sold.

The family returned to Bunbury in 1934, building a new house in Wittenoom Street.
Les described himself as a "dealer". Family legend has it that he had a brief and spectacularly unsuccessful career as an SP bookie at the Burlington Hotel. Margaret was reduced to taking in boarders (with meals) for the family to make ends meet.
In 1937 he opened a short-lived business selling new and second-hand furniture.

Les opened his last enterprise, a milk bar, in late 1937.

This business ran until at least 1950. We moved to Bunbury in late 1949, and I have a specific memory of the shop still running. I think the family left Les to run it, with hired staff. 1950 would have put him at age 65, at which point he could have got the old-age pension. He must have sold the business about then.

We moved to Stockley Road around 1951, and a little after Les and Margaret moved into a rather nice house directly across the road. I can remember the wide verandah around two sides. About this time Les progressively lost his sight (I think macular degeneration might have been the problem). In any event there was no treatment then available. After Margaret died in 1956 it became progressively harder for Les to live by himself. In around 1958 he moved to the braille Home for the Aged in Victoria Park, in Perth. The following photograph shows Les at this time. His sight has completely gone, and his face shows the results of skin cancers that plagued the Anglo-Saxons in the Australian climate.

I was at university in Perth through 1961-1965, and I would visit him regularly in his room at the Aged Home. He remained remarkably cheerful and positive despite the turn of events. When I arrived he would typically be listening to the broadcast of Parliament from Canberra - he was a ferocious Labor Party supporter. He would follow with interest all the family minutia, of who was doing what. Les still had his hearing. He would arrange a weekly outing with two other old codgers at the Home. One had a little sight in his left eye, and the other had a little sight in his right. Suitably equipped the trio would sally forth and walk down to the Victoria Park shops, cheerfully passing the time of day with regulars along their way. They would purchase a lottery ticket, perhaps place a bet at the TAB, and then make their way back in time for lunch. 

He met life head-on in his own way. As with my other grandparents, life hadn't dealt him any favours and he to manage the best he could.

He died in 1977, aged 92.

### Alice Victoria Atkins (1887-1946)

Alice followed her siblings George and Leslie to Bunbury. She married Lewis Braund, the brother of George's wife Dolly, in Bunbury, in 1908. They had moved to 21 Nelson St, 
[Williamstown](https://www.victorianplaces.com.au/williamstown), Victoria by 1914. Lewis is a "driver". By 1934, they are at 85 Elphin St, Williamstown, and Lewis is a "pensioner". By 1941 they are at 120 Woods St, 
[Newport](https://www.victorianplaces.com.au/newport). Alice died there in 1944, and Lewis died in 1966. They had five children.

## Parent Generation

We have a photo of the eldest three siblings, dated about 1918.

### Murray Lewis Atkins (1912-1932)

We have the following photo of Lily and Murray Atkins, dated about 1930. It shows the Australian enthusiam of shooting things that moved (and chopping down things that didn't). One doubts that the poor kangaroo was destined for the table.

Murray worked in the family businesses at Rocky Point and Scarborough. He was involved in a traffic accident on 28 November 1932, and died a day later.

The *West Australian*, 20 December 1932, reported the inquest:

> SCARBOROUGH TRAGEDY.  Lights and Brakes at Fault.  
At the Perth Courthouse yesterday, the Coroner (Mr. T. Y. A. Lang, P.M.) con ducted an inquest on the deaths of Peter Riela (37), single, a native of Holland,
and Murray Atkins (20), single, of Beach Avenue, Scarborough. Both fatalities were the outcome of a collision on the Scarborough-road, on November 28, between a car driven by Atkins and a spring cart driven by Peter Baroiolo. Riela was seated beside the driver of the car, and was killed almost instantly by the left shaft of the cart, which smashed through the windscreen of the car and pierced his chest.  
The Coroner was assisted by Sergeant Lynes. and Mr. D. M. Cleland (instructed by Messrs Villeneuve, Smith and Keall) represented the driver of the cart. Dr. I. O. Thorburn, medical registrar at Perth Hospital, stated that Atkins had died, in his opinion, from loss of blood and shock. He had a bad cut under the left arm, and one of the arteries was severed.  
Leslie William Atkins, father of the deceased, said he was in his car on the night of November 28, when his son was driving towards Perth from Scarborough. Riela was in the front seat next to his son. When the car was nearing the bridge over the Njookenbooroo canal, witness saw something which he thought was a cow, on the other side of the bridge, and on the left side of the road. His son apparently saw it at the same time, because he eased up and went slowly over the bridge. Witness did not see any light. The driver then turned to his right a little, and a collision occurred just on the Perth side of the bridge. The car was almost stopped. Witness did not realise that the object he saw was a horse and cart until the crash. The horse mounted the front of the car, which was considerably damaged.  
A plan of the locality was produced by Constable Cummings. He said that a hurricane lamp was found in the canal by Constable Richardson on the following morning. Constable Grey said he examined both vehicles, and found that one of the brakes of the car was less effective than the other. This would cause the car to swerve to the right when the brake was applied. Several witnesses stated that Baroiolo had told them that he was carrying a hurricane lamp in his hand while he was driving the cart, and Alexander Della, a dairyman, said that Baroiolo had a lamp in his hand when he came to store some milk at witness's place just before the accident.  
Baroiolo stated in evidence that he had been coming from Della's place with his employer's horse and cart, and was approaching the bridge, when he saw the lights of a car coming towards him from the direction of Scarborough. The car appeared to be going very fast, so witness went as far as possible to the left of the road, driving with one wheel in the sand at the side of the road. The car came on and struck the cart with the left front wheel, and witness was thrown out and knocked senseless. He remembered the police coming and looking for his lamp, which he had had in his right hard. They did not find it then, but they showed it to him on the following morning.  
The Coroner found that the two deceased died, from injuries received in the collision of a motor car and a horse-drawn vehicle on the night of November 28. He added that the cause of the collision was contributed to by the inefficient lighting of the cart, and the faulty brakes of the motor car, and drew attention to the regulations for the lighting of horse-drawn vehicles.

Les was in the back seat, and was uninjured. The horse, surprisingly, was uninjured.

### Lily Mariner Atkins (1915-2017)

### Colin Ernest Atkins (1920-2003)

(incomplete)

The *Stirling Times* of 6 August 1986 reported:

> Colin's family moved from Bunbury to settle at Scarborough in 1930. His father, Les, bought the land on The Esplanade for 300 pounds. Les, a carpenter, built a guest house and tea rooms on it. Colin said that the tearooms were one of the first real shops in the area. They had no electricity, and a well and a pump were used for water. The family lived in a weatherboard house where the Nookenburra is now while the tearooms were being built. When they moved into the house their lifestyle changed considerably.  
"Scarborough was a very isolated place in those days," Colin said. "We hardly saw anyone during the winter."  
Colin said there was only one bus into town from Scarborough each day. It would leave at 7:50am and there wasn't a bus back to Scarborough until 6pm. Buses ran more frequently between Perth and Osborne Park. Colin and his brothers and sisters went to school at St. Mary's in Leederville. They would catch the bus in the morning but would have to walk home to Osborne Park in the afternoon. "It was a long walk," Colin said. "Occasionally Mr. Della, who owned the diary in Scarborough, would come by with his horse and cart and give us a lift."  
Colin had a glint in his eye when he spoke of the privileges which came from living at the tearooms. His dad had built an open air dance floor where he held dances on Saturday and Sunday nights during the summer. Colin said his oldest sister Ivy had been one of Perth's top jazz pianists. She would invite all the jazz players she knew to play at the tearooms. "So we often had a seven piece jazz band to listen to," Colin said. "It was so lively around here." Colin said his dad didn't charge an entry fee because of licensing regulations. But members of the Scarborough Surf Club would take up a silver coin collection. "The thing I liked about those dances was the money I collected from the beer bottles that were left behind. I eventually saved up enough money to buy my first bike for five pounds."  
Colin said he had always been a beach lover. He was probably one of Scarborough's first surfers. He surfed on a wooden board made by his father. The wooden surfboards were about 30cm thick and anywhere between one and two metres long. "Dad, being a carpenter, made about 300 of these and hired then out for six pence a day. Of course, the devils never brought them back, so my job was to round all the boards up."  
In the middle of the depression in 1934, Colin's family moved back to Bunbury.

Editor's note: Colin travelled to Leederville to school, but his elder sisters and brother had already left school. He would have walked home *from* Osborne Park. The surfboards were 30cm *wide*, not thick. In fact, the photo of the Atkins Tearooms shows three youths heading for the beach with such surfboards. The surfer put their body *on* the board and rode the broken wave into shore. The surfer did not stand on these boards.
