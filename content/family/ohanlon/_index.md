## Great-Grandparent Generation

### Timothy O'Hanlon (1841-1886)

We know little definite about his early life. A death notice (see below) tells us he was the second son of Patrick O'Hanlon of County Cork, Ireland, and that he was 44 years of age when he died. This places his birth date around 1841.

Timothy O'Hanlon's descendants are shown in the following family tree.

He may have arrived in 1860. There is a *Tim Hanlan*, Irish, aged 22, labourer, on the *Lord Raglan*, which arrived in Melbourne on 25 November 1860.
In the
[passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B172F47-F96C-11E9-AE98-9B7C7338DD09?image=162#) he is ticket number 8339 (5 from the bottom).

The *Age* of 26 November 1860 provided the standard cryptic report:

>Lord Raglan, White Star ship, 1905 tons, Joseph Roper, from Liverpool, 23rd August. Passengers— cabin : Mr. and Mrs. Dickson and family (5), Miss Blackmore, Mr. and Mrs. Everest and child, Rev. Mr. Harcus, Mrs. Harcus and family (6),, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy, Mrs. Richmond, Mrs. and Miss Blyth, Messrs Black, Wilkinson, B. K. Smith, A. G. Smith, and 243 in the second cabin and steerage. Lorimer, Mackie and Co., agents.

He married Mary Ann Kavanagh in Bendigo, in 1872. Several of the children were born in the Bendigo district, and they then moved to Rochester (a farming area) around 1874. In around 1878 Timothy selected 
[block 60A, parish of Kotupna](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-232062402/view), and the family moved to the farm about 1880. Some sort of basic house would have to be built before the family could move in. This was about 8km south of the town of Nathalia. At the same time 
[John O'Hare](/family/ohare/#john-joseph-ohare-1833-1898) selected a block in the parish of Barwo, some 5km to the north-west of Nathalia.

He died suddenly in 1886, aged 44. We have the following reports. It would seem that the poetry in these reports was written by his wife Mary Ann.

The *Nathalia Herald and Picola, Narioka, Kotupna and Moira Advertiser* of 7 January 1886 tells us:

>DEATH OF MR. T. O'HANLON.  
We regret to announce the death of Mr. Timothy O'Hanlon, which occurred at his residence, Deep Creek, Kotupna, yesterday, after a very short illness. The deceased seemed perfectly well when he retired to rest on Monday evening, and after some conversation, said it was time to go sleep. He turned over and almost immediately fell off the bed. Medical assistance was obtained and the usual restoratives applied, but the patient never rallied, remaining unconscious to the time of his death. The cause of death was apoplexy. Mr. O'Hanlon was an old resident of Kotupna, and was well known and much respected by a large circle of friends. He was 44 years of age, and seemed to be, up to the time of his seizure, in strong bodily health, the news of his sudden demise coming with a shock to all who knew him. He will be interred in the Nathalia Cemetery to-morrow. Deceased leaves a wife and several children.

The *Leader* of 23 January 1886 tells us:

>DEATHS.  
O'HANLON. On the 6th January, at his residence, Deep Creek, Kotupna, after a short illness, Timothy O'Hanlon, second son of Mr. Patrick O'Hanlon, Cork, Ireland. Deceased was an old resident, well known and respected by a large circle of friends. Aged 44 years.


The *Advocate* of 13 February 1886 tells us:

>DEATHS.  
O'HANLON. On the 6th of January, at his residence, Deep Creek, Kotupna, Timothy O'Hanlon, the beloved husband of Mary Anne O'Hanlon, and second son of Patrick O'Hanlon, County Cork, Ireland.  
A loving husband, true and kind  
He proved to be, both in heart and mind;  
A loving father, true as well;  
When he on earth with us did dwell.  
But now he is gone to a better home, while I, his wife, and 7 children, his loss deplore. Lord have mercy on his soul .

The *Advocate* of 8 January 1887:

>IN MEMORIAM.  
O'HANLON. In memory of the late Timothy O'Hanlon who departed this life at his residence, Coolmone Farm, on 6th January, 1886, by his loving wife, M. A. O'Hanlon.  
On this day twelve months ago it was a sad case to see  
the Almighty God's will done to take my husband, who was always true and dear to me.  
As it was God's holy will to take him o'er,  
I hope to meet him in that blessed land where we will part no more.  
May his soul rest in peace.

### Mary Ann Kavanagh (1850-1926)

Mary Ann Kavanagh was born in the town of
[Cavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan), in County Cavan, Ireland in about 1850. She and her sister Elizabeth emigrated to Melbourne in 1870. Her brother 
William Kavanagh had emigrated earlier.
She married Timothy O'Hanlon in 1872. She was widowed in 1886, with six children aged 13, 12, 10, 7, 5 and 3, with another about to be born. She raised them all, on the family farm in Kotupna. She retired to Melbourne in 1915, and died there in 1926.

Mary Ann's parents and siblings (and their descendants) are shown in the following family tree.

The *Nathalia Herald* of 4 May 1926 provided the following obituary:

>It is with regret we have to record the demise of Mrs M. A. O'Hanlon, which occurred at her late residence, 16 Lindsay Avenue, St. Kilda, in the early morn of Tuesday, April 27th. The late Mrs O'Hanlon resided at Kotupna from 1880 to 1915, in the latter year leaving to reside at St. Kilda. Perhaps no one better known (and most favorably, too) ever lived in the Goulburn Valley. She was one of the great pioneers who with her late husband, Mr T. O'Hanlon (who predeceased her about 40 years ago), came along and accepted the hard knocks, as well as the easy ones, so familiar to the illustrious pioneers who blazed the track of this great southern land. Many are the experiences that could be related of those early days. For instance, Nathalia was then known as Barwo, and had only a few residences (if they could be called such). The Blakes, the
Manifolds and the Kostadts were there, and a street now bears the name of each of those people, also some others who came along about the same time as the O'Hanlon family. The kangaroos, the emus and the wild horses (then named the "fizzers") roamed at large, and the Kotupna plains were a favourite place for them. Now what a transformation! A beautiful plateau from the Goulburn to the Murray in verdure and in green!  
The late Mrs O'Hanlon did her part nobly and well. The deceased lady came from stalwart stock: the Kavanaghs from Cavan in the North of Ireland. Her father there occupied a good position, and took his share of interest in public affairs. This strain is kept well alive to-day by one of her sons, whose efforts and ambitions are known to most people around Nathalia. Again, the Kavanaghs had literary gifts, and the late Mrs O'Hanlon was a poetess of no mean order. Mrs O'Hanlon was married to the late Mr Timothy O'Hanlon at Bendigo in the seventies, and for a time they lived there, and afterwards at Top Creek, Rochester. Then her late husband selected land between Nathalia and McCoy's Bridge. The sudden death of her husband in 1886 was a great blow, and all the more so because of being left with seven children. Notwithstanding she prospered, and reared a family to manhood and womanhood that do her credit. A second great grief was the death of a daughter in 1894, but through all her spirit never failed - she worked on and succeeded against droughts, floods and other visitations.  
The late Mrs O'Hanlon possessed a kind and benevolent disposition and many can tell of her hospitality . Every weary traveller was welcomed and "the cup that cheers" given to them. Again, she possessed the true Christian spirit of a broad tolerant Christianity. A strict Catholic, she loved her church, and the Numurkah and Nathalia Catholic Churches owe much to her generosity. She most regular attendant the whole of her life.  
Mrs O'Hanlon has left six surviving children, viz., Mr P.D.K. O'Hanlon who lives at and owns the family homestead at Kotupna ; Mr E.G. O'Hanlon (J. L. Jeffers and Co.) The Olderfleet, Melbourne ; Mr M.J. O'Hanlon, of Elwood ; Miss Marie, who tenderly nursed he mother in her last illness ; Mrs Stevens, wife of Dr Stevens, of Gladesville, Sydney ; and Mrs M.J. Galligan, of Anthony Horden's Emporium, Sydney, whose husband is an old employee of the firm. All her children visited her prior to her death.  
Her remains were conveyed to Numurkah by the early morning train from Melbourne on Wednesday last, and then by special train to Nathalia. Considering the short notice, a very large assemblage met and followed "all that was mortal" to the Nathalia cemetery. The pall bearers were her three stalwart sons, Mr Henry Kavanagh (nephew), and Messrs Alex. McDonell and John Broom, old friends of the family. The councillors of the Namurkah Shire were largely in attendance out of respect to her and sympathy for her councillor son. The Rev Father Murphy officiated at the Graveside, and Messrs A B. Binger and Sons had charge of the mortuary arrangements.

Mary Ann and her sister Eliza arrived in Melbourne on the ship 
[Alumbagh](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Alumbagh_(ship,_1863))
on 20 November 1870. On the 
[passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B3D2DF1-F96C-11E9-AE98-E9BFA8524AEB?image=138#)
they are about two-thirds down the page. Aged 22 and 18, respectively.
They are both "servants", meaning domestic servants.

The *Argus* of 31 October 1870 reports the arrival in the usual cryptic fashion:

>Alumbagh, ship, 1,137 tons, John G. Lowe, from London via Plymouth 1st August, with 412 Government immigrants, W. H. Pearse, M.D., surgeon-superintendent. Holmes, White, and Co., agents.

The *Herald* of 31 October 1870
tells us:

>THE IMMIGRANT SHIP ALUMBAGH.  
This morning the Immigration Commissioners proceeded on board the ship Alumbagh, which arrived in the Bay yesterday. The purport of the visit was to inspect the immigrants arriving by that vessel. To-morrow morning the Commissioners will hold a meeting on board the Alumbagh, after which the vessel will be brought alongside the Williamstown Railway Pier, when a clearance of the passengers will be made, the female portion being brought on by special train, from which they will proceed to the Immigration Depot, Latrobe-street, where everything is in readiness to ensure their comfort. The new arrivals are classed as follows : — 80 married people, 150 single women, 96 single men, 38 boys, 44 girls, and 5 infants. Miss Robinson acted as matron, and the immigrants were under the charge of Dr. Pearse, Captain Lowe and the ship's officers acting in conjunction with Miss Robinson. 

On 2 November 1870 it tells us:


>IMMIGRATION DEPOT.  
The female immigrants per Alambagh were duly housed in the depot, Latrobe-street, during the afternoon of yesterday. The inspection made of
the immigrants on board ship by the immigration Commissioners, yesterday, passed off very satisfactorily. Last evening thirty-five of the warrant-holders were claimed by their friends, and went away in high glee to their various homes. During to-day many more of this class have been called for by their relations or friends, and took a kindly farewell of such of their fellow-passengers as still remain in the depot. The ladies' committee meet to-morrow morning, at 11 o'clock, to portion out the needlework executed by the female immigrants during the voyage. The time for the hiring of the Government female immigrants has not yet been decided ; but Friday may probably be set aside for this purpose. 

In the event, the
*Herald* of 7 November 1870 tells us that everything went off swimmingly.

> The Immigration Depot.  
At 11 o'clock this morning the female immigrants arriving per ship Alumbagh were placed on hire at the Immigration Depot, Latrobe-street. The appearance of these new arrivals, as they were seated in the hiring-room, prior to the business of the day commencing, was one particularly neat and tidy, fully bearing out the opinion expressed by Mrs. Ferguson, the matron of the depot, that a better class of Government female immigrants had never been received into the depot. Previous to the doors being thrown open to the public, a large number of ladies and others wishing to secure the services of the girls, thronged the waiting-rooms at the depot, eagerly seeking for cards of admission to the hiring room. The number of the female immigrants placed on hire was forty-one, classed as follows: cooks and laundresses, 6 ; general servants, 14 ; nurse-maids, 9 ; housemaids, 14 ; independent of several who had come out under the warrant system. Amongst the cooks was one who spoke French and Spanish fluently. But very little time was lost in getting to business after the doors of the hiring room were opened to those in search of such domestic labor as was offered, and in about two hour's time or less the whole of the girls, with the exception of two nursemaids and two general servants, had accepted service at rates as follows : — Nursemaids, from £12 to £18 per annum ; general servants, £16 to £22 per annum ; housemaids, £18 to £22 per annum ; cooks and laundresses, £20 to £25 per annum. It must be a great satisfaction to all concerned that these newly engaged servants go away to different homes bearing with them characters of an unexceptionable kind.

We have a list of the
[assisted female immigrants](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/E29C24B9-F1B1-11E9-AE98-FDBA81E5D083?image=139#)
(and the following page). Mary Ann and Eliza are not on the list. They must have come out on the "warrant system", nominated to their brother who by that time was a Police Constable in Bendigo.

Having being suddenly tasked with running the farm, she has to manage as best she could. The following letter in the
*Shepparton Advertiser* of 26 August 1898 explains a financial issue.

>AN EXPLANATION.  
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ADVERTISER.  
Sir, In your report of the County Court case, Kilpatrick v. O’Hanlon, it is stated that Kilpatrick, in answer to Mr Johnson, said he was "further induced to give a full cheque because he had a mortgage over defendant’s stock.” Now, as defendant, let me explain : About five or six years ago. I bought, through Kilpatrick, a block of land adjoining my homestead. I am administratrix of the homestead property. After I had paid a deposit and was arranging for a transfer of the land I had bought, Kilpatrick suddenly discovered that I could not raise any money on the original 320 acres, because I was administratrix; consequently not legal to obtain money thereon. I confess I was astonished, and was in an ugly corner ; because if I withdrew from the purchase my deposit, etc., would all be forfeited. The money required was only about £160. Kilpatrick suggested, as the only means out of the difficulty, to mortgage my stock for twelve months, and at the end of that period I surely could pay it off. To mortgage stock does not look nice ; but as the only means available I did so. I did this because Kilpatrick said no money could be raised on the original 320 acres, as I was administratrix. At the end of those twelve months I paid every penny of the  £160 ; but I neglected to get a discharge, simply because I thought at the time that when I paid the full amount it there ended. It appears a
discharge must be obtained ; otherwise the mortgage runs legally on. Now, this stock mortgage was arranged some five years ago. Your readers can judge of my surprise when I saw this “mortgage affair” brought to light on last County Court day. It was the first mortgage I had anything to do with ; hence my want of knowledge in seeing to its discharge. From those facts it will be seen that the mortgage under notice was arranged as the only loop hole of escape from exceptional trying circumstances, and not the well-known ordinary course too well known to the majority of your readers. Thanking you for the insertion of this letter,  
I am, yours, etc.  
Mrs M. A. O’HANLON. Kotupna, August 20th.

The court case itself is
[here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article269973616)
(it involved the sale price of some barley). It also triggered an impassioned
[letter to the editor](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article280536037) by her son Patrick. In turn, this caused the editor to attach the following note:

>[It appears very strange that Messrs Kilpatrick and Co. should take the stand indicated by the above letter (from Patrick O'Hanlon), when they, against the advice of their solicitors, declined to take the costs they were entitled to, as winners of the case, and told them they would give it to the plaintiff who, being a widow, they (Kilpatrick and Co.) considered she was put into the position by the advice of her son; the saving to her in this matter was fully £30. Ed.]

It seems that Patrick was a serial, and singularly unsuccessful, litigant.

She moved to Melbourne in early 1916. The
*Nathalia Herald and Picola, Narioka, Kotupna and Moira Advertiser* of 14 March 1916 reported a district farewell:

>Presentation to Mrs. O'Hanlon.  
A Pleasing Function.  
On Saturday, 4th March, a number of friends of Mrs O'Hanlon, who has retired and gone to Melbourne to live, met at Gray's Bridge Hotel, to bid her farewell and show in some small way their appreciation of her services to the district.
The Shire President (Cr. Alex. McDonnell) presided.
A most bountiful repast had been
prepared by Mrs. Gray, and was
greatly enjoyed by those present.  
The chairman said they all knew
the reason they had met that day. They were present to say farewell
to a highly esteemed friend in Mrs O'Hanlon who was going from their midst to live in Melbourne. From childhood he had had the
greatest admiration for Mrs O'Hanlon. She had the right to be called
one of the pioneers of the district. Mrs. O'Hanlon lost her husband while the family was young, and the way she had brought them up was a great credit to her. The way she had reared her family was an example to us all. He had known her
for 38 years and could not find
words enough to show his appreciation for Mrs O'Hanlon, who was a woman held in the highest esteem
throughout the district. He thought she was doing the right thing to retire and let those she had battled
for against drought and flood look after her. It fell to his pleasing
duty to present her, on behalf of Kotupna and Nathalia friends, with a beautiful tea and coffee service, suitably inscribed, and trusted she would live long to enjoy it, and remember the good days she lived in Kotupna. (Applause).  
Cr. J. Ball said he was pleased to be present to do honor to Mrs O'Hanlon. He had known her for
a long time and she was one of the
early pioneers of the district, and she had done a great deal better than a lot of the men. Now that
her family were able to do for them-selves he was pleased to know she was going to take a well earned rest. Mrs O'Hanlon was well known throughout the district for
to hospitality. He trusted she would live for a long time and enjoy
a well earned rest.  
Mr A. Geary said that as one who had gone to school with the family in the Old Country, where they were greatly respected, and one who had known them in this district, he was pleased to say a few words in regret in losing Mrs O'Hanlon from the district, and hoped she would get on well in Melbourne.  
Cr. J. H. Tuckett said there was no doubt great credit was due to Mrs O'Hanlon for the way she had brought her family up, and it had held her up to men in the district for the way she had managed her farm, land when it was taken up first was recognised to be the worst in the district. No lady deserved more credit than she did. He wished her long life and prosperity.  
Dr. Keyes said he could add very little to what the previous speakers had said. Mrs O'Hanlon had been held in high esteem throughout the district and they were sorry to lose her. He wished her every happiness in her new sphere.  
Mr. A. Rathbone said he had known Mrs O'Hanlon for 25 years and she had been a very good neighbour. He always found her trying to do her best for the district and herself. She was going to have a well deserved rest, which she had
thoroughly earned.  
Rev. Father Tehan said it gave him great pleasure to join in bidding farewell to Mrs O'Hanlon. From his short acquaintance of her he had found out her hospitality.
He could only wish her every happiness in her future home.  
Senior Constable Steedman, as a newcomer, said that from the first
time he had shaken hands with Mrs. OHanlon he had the greatest respect for her. After so successful a struggle he was pleased she was going to take a rest and wished her
every prosperity in her new home.  
Mr. S. McLees said he could not say very much as he was a newcomer to the district, but the little time he known Mrs O'Hanlon she
been a good neighbour. He was sorry she was going away, but was
glad was to rest.  
Cr. P.D.K. O'Hanlon, on behalf of his mother, said he had to sincerely thank them for their very fine present. His mother had resided in Kotupna for 38 years, and was leaving that home and himself and was going to take a well earned
rest in the eventide of her life.
When she looked at the present it would not only remind her of her friends in Kotupna and Nathalia, but would recall many happy associations of the past. He hoped they would accept the thanks of his
mother. He was pleased to see the
shire president there that day. He might say that during his term of office the duties had never before carried out with more dignity and honor. He again sincerely
thanked them. (Applause).

Her sons Edward and Martin had already sold their interest in the farms, and had moved away. Patrick stayed in Kotupna on the original farm. It seems her three daughters moved to Melbourne with her.

The *Numurkah Leader* of 5 May 1926 reported her death:

>DEATHS.  
O'HANLON. On the 27th April, at her residence, 16 Lindsay Avenue, St. Kilda, Mary Ann, relic of the late T. O'Hanlon, Kotupna, and beloved mother of Patrick D. K., Edward G., Michael J., Sissie (deceased), Marie, Elizabeth (Mrs Stevens), and Helena (Mrs Galligan). R.I.P.  
Dear Mother, thy enfolding love was boundless as the sea.  
The great solicitude and care, one with Infinity.  
Love faltered not at grief or pain, or duty's hard decree  
When Heaven planned a flawless gem, she fashioned thee  
A spirit bright with duties done, to grace God's Ample Fold.  
A nature great with virtue's attributes - heart of Gold.

The poetry in the notice was perhaps written by her son Martin.

### Elizabeth Kavanagh (1862-1934)

The *Cobram Courier* of 27 September 1934 provided an obituary:

>Mrs ELIZABETH LEAVEY.  
A pioneer of the Sandmount district in the person of Mrs Elizabeth Leavey, wife of the late Mr Thomas Leavey, passed away at the residence of her son-in-law, Mr. J. Parnell, Cobram, on Friday. Deceased, who was in her 78th year was a native of County Cavan, Ireland, and with her late husband, came from Bendigo in 1876; and selected a property at Sandmount, where with her late husband she reared a family of three sons and three daughters consisting of Mary (Mrs Brady, deceased), Edward, Margaret (Mrs J. Parnell), Thomas, William, and Bessie (Mrs Logan). Deceased was of the earliest settlers that helped to open up the district fifty-eight years ago. and
proved an excellent friend to many. The funeral took place at the Numurkah Cemetery on Saturday afternoon, Rev. Father Ellis reading the burial service.


### William Kavanagh (1841-1901)

William Kavanagh seems to have arrived in Melbourne on the *Ocean Chief* on 26 June 1857. He married Mary Ann Behan in 1867, and they had four children. He died in 1901, aged 60 years.

In the [passenger list](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3B05F129-F96C-11E9-AE98-27F6998F8082?image=75#) he is about two-thirds down the left page, is a "labourer", and says he is 20 years old. He was probably more like 17.

The *Argus* of 30 June 1857 reported:

>The Ocean Chief, 79 days from Liverpool, arrived at Melbourne on the 26th ult. Several cases of small-pox having occurred on board during her passage, the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has placed the said ship and the crew and passengers thereof under quarantine for a period of fourteen clear days from the convalescence of the last case of small-pox. The following are the names of the saloon passengers: Mr. and Mrs. Lawson, Mr. Lawson, Miss Lawson, Mrs. M'Clelland and child, Master and Misses (2) Hewitt, Miss Frith, Miss Forbes, Miss Williams, Miss Grimley, Miss Worthington, Mr. Palmer. Mr. Stoker, and Mr.T.H. Kidd. It will be satisfactory for the friends and relatives of the passengers by this ship to know that out of the fourteen cases of small-pox that have occurred during the voyage, only one has resulted fatally, and that was a child aged four years, named Amelia Vail. Two other deaths occurred from natural causes on the passage out. Only one case is at present under treatment, so that we may expect a speedy release of the ship from quarantine.


In 1870 he seems to have been a police constable in
[Raywood](https://www.victorianplaces.com.au/raywood), a mining town some 25km north of Bendigo. The *Leader* of 17 December 1870 tells us:

>The following payment has been made from the police reward fund during the past week:— To constable William Kavanagh, at
Raywood, Sandhurst district, £3, in acknowledgement of his services in the arrest and prosecution of John Ryan, sentenced to six years for housebreaking and stealing from a dwelling.

His sisters would have joined his family there - they were both married in the Bendigo area  (respectively, two years and six years after they arrived).

Late he was a hotel publican, mine host of the
[Cavan Hotel](https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/96129) in Fitzroy, Melbourne. The *Argus* of 4 March 1901 tells us:

>SUDDEN DEATH.  
A remarkably sudden death occurred last evening at the Cavan Hotel, Brunswick street, Fitzroy. Mr. Synon Kavanagh, aged 25, the son of the licensee, Mr. William Kavanagh, was taken ill while the family were at tea, and died in a few minutes. He had not been suffering from any complaint for some time past, but was in rather delicate health. Shortly before 7 o'clock last evening he complained of feeling faint, and said that he would not have any tea. He was assisted to another room and was laid on a sofa, but his condition became rapidly worse, and Mr. Yelland, M.B., was sent for. Kavanagh was dead on his arrival, and, as he was not able to state definitely the cause of death, an inquest will be necessary. Death is supposed to be due to heart failure.

William died three days later. The *Age* of 8 March 1901 reported his death:

>KAVANAGH. On the 7th March, at his residence, Cavan Hotel, Brunswick-street, Fitzroy, William, the loved husband of Mary, and father of H. G., W. J. and E. J. Kavanagh, of Victorian Railways, ex-sergeant of police, aged 60 years. R.I.P. 

Later, the  *Age* of 11 April 1901 reported:

>WILLS AND BEQUESTS  
The will of William Kavanagh, late of Cavan Hotel, Fitzroy, licensed victualler, has also been lodged for probate. Testator executed his will on 5th February last year, and died on the 7th of last month. The real estate was valued at £4500, and the personal at £790, all of which was devised to the widow and children.

## Grandparent Generation

When their father Timothy died in 1886, the seven children were brought up by their rather indomitable mother Mary Ann, on the family farm. They existed as a family collective (somewhat like the O'Hares at Snugborough) with the three boys working the farm. The farm, enlarged over time, was divided in some way between the boys. Edward and Michael sold their shares about 1915, and set up business in Melbourne. Patrick took over the original family farm, and continued to farm.

### Michael John O'Hanlon (1878-1958)

#### The Kotupna Years

Presumably all seven children were educated at the local school, to age 14. Small country towns at that time (pre popular entertainment via cinema and radio) had a vibrant community life.

Michael John  was the Honorary Secretary of the Kotupna Debating Society and was
[president](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article280447892) of the local branch of the
[Australian Natives Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Natives%27_Association). He had a considerable literary bent, perhaps encouraged by his mother. 
In 1903 he won first prize (and 1 guinea) for an essay submitted to the Namurkah Competitive Exhibition. The essay was published in the *Namurkah Leader*
[here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191705641).
He is the only poet to grace these narratives, so it worth reproducing two of his published efforts in full.

The *Numurkah Leader* of 22 July 1897

> THE CRIMINAL  
(BY M. J. O HANLON, KOTUPNA.)  
They say by instinct it is there,  
The sense that prompts to deeds unfair.  
A fire innate that burns within  
And kindles blood to acts of sin.  
A fierce desire to commit  
An act which law will not permit.  
But let it be not understood  
It's that alone that dons the hood,  
So black, so foul, impure and dire,  
The essence of a living fire;  
To be avoided and abhorred,  
Repulsed and scorned and deplored.  
It's habit turns from good to ill  
And in the heart the germs instil,  
That nourished long will spring and bloom,  
And over virtue cast a gloom :  
And glow forth with a ruddy fire  
Equal to the innate desire.  
The youth, with tendencies quite pure,  
Will slowly sink and ne'er endure,  
When left to revel in a place.  
With small temptations to disgrace;  
For one appeased, will rise again  
On an increased and broader plane.  
And thus command by precedent,  
To be appeased without comment:  
For once performed, the act remains,  
And the same privilege retains ;  
While will, will give the struggle o'er  
By reason of its fail before,  
And so along by slow degrees  
Like chronic malady or disease,  
Vice gathers strength at every turn,  
And bids command in accents stern :  
While virtue bows in grim decay  
And slowly, grimly ebbs away.  
And so crime thrives by negligence,  
And stolid cold indifference;  
By those placed to train the young.  
And mark for ere it has begun  
To leave its tragic mark behind.  
The tendency ev'ly destined.  
The canker rooted will remain  
And later effort prove in vain  
To bend the evil stem, now strong  
From deep indulgence in the wrong.  
For that is gone which once would heal,  
That shame which convicts ne'er can feel.

Numurkah Leader (Vic. : 1895 - 1948), Thursday 24 March 1898, page 7

>WHEN LITTLE SADIE SMILED.  
With flaxen hair and rosy-dimpled cheeks,  
And laughing eyes that beauty's charm completes,  
For six short years, unclouded, happy years,  
She shed a sweet and happy halo round,  
And installed joy where grief before was found.  
Within the sweet and baby smiling face  
There was a charm that sadness did deface.  
And heavy hearts from mourning were beguiled  
— When little Sadie smiled.  
And callous hearts, made sad from warring long  
With sorrow, grief, and injury and wrong ;  
The hearts that long, long, long had ceased to be  
Warmed by the flame of human sympathy ;  
That saw the woes of men without a sigh,  
Or felt a thrill at pity's piercing cry,  
Were wakened from their cold and tranced sleep,  
Were called from where sternness her vigils keep,  
Were softy moved, were softened and made mild  
— When little Sadie smiled.  
And great, strong men, with valiant hearts and brave.  
That from the world did never mercy crave ;  
That trod through paths with deadly dangers fraught,  
Nor safety, with a shrinking dif'dence bought:  
That never to the despot's nod did bow,  
Or felt the chill of fear upon their brow :  
Could not, though rugged were their forms, withstand  
Her laughing, sweet and gentle-voiced command ;  
And rigid sternness was a term illstyled  
— When little Sadie smiled.  
In fever's grasp upon her bed she lay.  
And feebly tossed while life slow ebbed away.  
A luminary, heaven did allot  
To be the joy of a poor humble cot,  
Was passing now to where the angels dwelt;  
And when with reason's parting light she felt  
Life could no longer death's assaults endure,  
She feebly smiled, fond hearts to reassure.  
Ah then! then these hearts were wrung with ag'ny wild.  
— When little Sadie smiled.  
M. J. O'HANLON. Kotupna, 16 3 '98.

We have at least two others,
[here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article280609982) and
[here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article280534969).
On the other hand, the following brief note appeared in the
*Numurkah Leader* of 21 October 1898:

>NOTICE TO CORRESPONDENT.  
M. J. O'Hanlon, Kotupna.- Verses respectfully declined. 

Perhaps the poem *When Little Sadie Smiled* was reflective of the death of his sister Cissie, at age 15 in 1894.

The following report is from 1898, and shows that Mary Ann had passed on the management of the farm.

>We are just in receipt of a sample of barley which is somewhat unique in the present season. It is from the farm of Mr O’Hanlon, Kotupna, and looks like a sample that any grower might be proud of. The area on which it was grown was 38 acres of loamy clay, and averaged 5 3/4 bags. The owner of the threshing machine, Mr Royal, who threshed through the Kyabram and Kotupna districts, has given tho grower permission to state that it is amongst the best samples which he has threshed during many years’ experience in this and other localities. The ground was ploughed and sowed in the ordinary way, and no fertilisers were used, but the soil shows by this result that, probably from its clayey nature, it is well adapted to the growing of this particular cereal.  
—Nathalia Herald.

The *Numurkah Leader* of 13 February 1903 had several interesting items:

>NATHALIA.  
Mr Dan Colgan, proprietor of the "Murchison Times," Cue, W.A., has returned to pay a visit to his parents and friends in this district. He speaks in glowing terms of the opportunities in the West for making money, and was very much surprised to find prospects in such a deplorable condition in this part of the Goulburn Valley.  
A dwelling house on one of the O'Hanlon farms, Kotupna, has been destroyed by fire. How the fire originated is unknown. I understand that the building was fully covered by insurance.

As a countryman, Michael John seems somewhat accident prone. The *Nathalia Herald and Picola, Narioka, Kotupna and Moira Advertiser* of 22 May 1906 reported:

>KICKED BY A HORSE.  
Whilst Mr. M. O'Hanlon, of Kotupna, was in Mr. Colgan's stable last week getting his horse, another animal in the next stall kicked him severely in the groin. He was disabled for some time, but is now able to get about with the aid of a stick. 

On 17 May 1907 the same journal of record tells us:

>Shocking Gun Accident.  
On Friday afternoon last a gun accident happened at Kotupna, when Mr Michael O'Hanlon was within an ace of losing his life. It seems that Mr J D Gleeson, of the Australian Widow's Fund Co, and Mr M. O'Hanlon were out shooting, and when within about two hundred yards from home, the latter was getting through a wire fence, holding two hares in one hand and his gun in the other. Whilst in a stooping position the gun caught on the wires and almost pulled it out of his hand and at the same time going off. The whole charge entered the muscular portion of the back and went upwards into the shoulder, making a ghastly wound. Mr Gleeson at once rushed to his assistance, but he
would not allow himself to be moved until the doctor arrived. Mr. Gleeson then drove rapidly to Nathalia, from whom the accident was first known in the town, and it was then thought the unfortunate young man's injuries were fatal. Dr. Keyes, Father Griffin and Nurse M'Donald made all haste out and then it was learned that there was no immediate
danger, but that an operation was necessary. The patient was conveyed home and Dr Keyes made him as comfortable as possible for the night. On Saturday Drs Keyes, Florance and Damman performed the necessary operation of removing a portion of the shoulder blade. The dangerous nature of the injuries caused great anxiety to the whole district, as "Mick" was one
of the great favourites of the community, and every day enquiries were made as to his condition. Yesterday Dr. Keyes informed us that his patient had turned the corner and was now doing splendidly, although some time must elapse before the wound heals.The doctor also says nothing but his fine constitution has saved him, most men would have died under similar injuries. 

On 22 February 1908 we are told:

>FALL FROM A HORSE. NATHALIA  
Mr. M. J. O'Hanlon. who a few months back was accidentally shot, was riding a horse at a walking pace along the road, when the animal stumbled and fell, throwing its rider to the ground. The rider sustained concussion of the brain, and had two of his ribs broken.

The *Numurkah Leader* of 21 July 1911 tells us:

>A very unpleasant and dangerous experience befell Mrs O'Hanlon of Kotupna on her way to church on Sunday last. Mr M. O'Hanlon was driving when the horse fell in the vehicle and his mother was precipitated on to the road, sustaining a broken finger and severe cuts about the face. 

#### The Melbourne Years

In 1911 he started to extricate himself from farming, and from Kotupna.

           caption= "O'Hanlon-McMahon Wedding. 1919" >}}

The *Argus* of 21 August 1915 has a report that was presumably written for them:

>HOUSES AND LAND. EXTENSIVE LAND SALES.  
M. F. O'Hanlon and Co., stock and station agents,
land and property salesmen, 237 Collins-street, report having sold since February 1: (16 sales detailed.)  
Total sales: £80,164.

He was married, to Eily McMahon, in 1919. We have a photograph of the bridal party, looking substantially prosperous.

Family legend has it that "grandfather crashed" in the depression.
Perhaps the "crash" predated the Depression.
The elements of the saga seem to be

- Late 1928. Three English confidence men, John Fergus Stone, Henry Barnes and Henry Harding, came to town, claiming to represent "big London investors". They took an expensive flat, and entertained lavishly. They started by floating a local shell company. 
The *Argus* of 8 November 1928 tells us

>Commercial and General Investment Trust Pty. Ltd. Registered Office, 405-407 Collins street, Melbourne. Capital £100,000 in £1 shares. Names subscribed to memorandum:- John Fergus Stone, 1 share; Henry Barnes, 1 share.

- They purported to acquire an asset. In the *Argus* of 7 December 1928:

>The Stock Exchange was advised yesterday afternoon by the directors of the Asia Amalgamated Tin Syndicate No Liability that the syndicate had sold its interest in two tin mining properties at Pichon, Siam to the Commercial and General Investment Trust Pty Ltd for £45,000. Shareholders in Asia Amalgamated will be given the right to apply for 50 shares, of £1 each at par for each share held. At the date of the last annual meeting there were 1,503 live shares in the syndicate, which owing to the poor response to calls, was in debt.

More correctly, the dodgy brothers had agreed to buy the mines, but had not yet paid for them.

- 1 February 1929. [Full page advertisements](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article204226734) were placed for shares in a new tin mining company. The money raised by that company is to pay the dodgy brothers for their "interests" in the Siam tin mines (not yet paid for). 

- 8 February 1929. [Full page advertisements](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article223751114) were placed in the Melbourne, Sydney and Perth press, selling to the public 50,000 shares in the Golden Washed Sands Pty Ltd.. Michael and Eily O'Hanlon owned the freehold to a sand deposit at Cranbourne, and the rights to remove sand from the Koo-Wee-Rup Canal. The dodgy brothers had somehow taken an "interest" in the property (presumably not yet paid for). The dodgy brothers had also set up the underwriting company. Any income from the sale of shares would have gone into an account controlled by them.

- Discussion in financial press [here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article234416825) and [here](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article244303748). The latter article did a clinical filleting of the dodgy brothers in general, and the Golden Washed Sands proposition in particular.

- By 18 March 1929 they had 
[done a runner](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article183809656), leaving an empty office. The particular trigger was the deadline of paying for the Siam tin mine.

- The *Sun News-Pictorial* of 18 March 1929 reported the immediate consequence:

>Golden Washed Sand  
The chairman of directors of Golden
Washed Sand Ltd (Mr. M. J. O'Hanlon) notifies that the promotion agreement with the Commercial and General Investment Trust Pty. Ltd. has been cancelled, and arrangements made with the original vendors, Mr.
and Mrs. O'Hanlon, to sell the sand deposits
at Cranbourne direct to the company for £10,400, subject to mortgages to be discharged to the company amounting to £2,100.

- We don't know the gory details of efforts to salvage the company. It would have been impossible to sell any more shares. The *Sun News-Pictorial* of 4 September 1929 reported the end:

>Golden Washed Sand  
The liquidator of Golden Washed Sand Ltd. (in liq.), Mr G. M. Fosbery, presented
a statement to creditors at a meeting yesterday showing a deficiency of £1469. Creditors are owed £1671. Assets total £202, comprising £190 uncalled capital and £12 allotment money owing.

#### The Balkuling Years

The Golden Washed Sands fiasco and the general commercial decline of the depression must have made Michael's commercial interests in Melbourne unviable. At the age of 52 he decided to return to farming. Just like the O'Hares in 1927, land in Victoria proved too expensive, and the O'Hanlon's moved to the wheatbelt of West Australia. 
The house in Elwood was sold, and enough capital was available to purchase a farm in
[Balkuling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkuling,_Western_Australia)
between York and Quairading in WA. 

The move from Melbourne was in May 1930. The *Age* of 2 May 1930 has an advertisement:

>CANARIES. Norwich, good birds, and Yorkshires, leaving. 31 Normandy-rd. Elwood.

and a day later

>Lounge Suite, moquette; Oak Dining table, oval; Wardrobe, Linos., Beds. Oak, Double; carpets , 12 x 9, 10.6 x 9; Gas stove. 31 Normandy-rd., Elwood.

The first evidence we have of them in WA is a brief sale report in
the *West Australian* of 7 August 1930

> M. J. O'Hanlon, Balkuling, 44 suckers 9/10

Suckers, I am reliably informed, are lambs. It seems clear that Michael moved to the farm (and fixed up the farm house) before Eily and the two children joined him.

[To be completed }

### Edward George O'Hanlon (1874-1932)

We have an obituary, from the *Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate* of 10 December 1932:

>OLD DUBBOITE GONE  
E. G. O'HANLON  
Mr. Edward George O'Hanlon, who died suddenly at St. Kilda private hospital on Saturday night, was a member of a well known Kotupna family, being the second son of the late Mr.
and Mrs. T. O'Hanlon who were among the earliest settlers in that locality. The late Mr O'Hanlon, who was 54 years of age, was a native of Bendigo, but at an early age came to Kotupna, where the greater part of his life was spent. Possessing a genial personality, as well as being a musician and vocalist of some merit, he made a host of friends. Some 25 years ago he left Kotupna, where he had been engaged in farming, for Dubbo, where he entered into a stock and station business in which he retained an interest up to the time of his death. Some years later the firm decided to open a Melbourne branch, which he managed, and later bought, and latterly he had been the sole proprietor of the stock and station agency known as J. L. Jeffers and Co., of Bourke Street, Melbourne.  
He is survived by two brothers and three sisters, viz. Messrs. P. D. K. O'Hanlon, Kotupna, M. J. O'Hanlon, West Australia, Miss M. O'Hanlon, St. Kilda, Mrs. Stevens, Gladsville, N.S.W,, and Mrs. Galligan, Mosman,
N.S.W. The remains were interred in the Nathalia cemetery. The Rev. Father Cremmens read the burial service. 

#### Uncle Eddie's Will

For perhaps 40 years after I entered the O'Hare family, a running saga was "Uncle Eddie's will". Eddie was the uncle of Sheila (Kerry's mother), and had long since been dead. An annuity had come to Sheila since she was a young woman, and had gone on for close to seventy years. Sometime around 2005, the Trustees of this arrangement suggested that that it be wound up, and Sheila and the other recipients agreed in some fashion to forego their inheritance. The next generation received a cash payout of some $1700 each. 

It is clear that "Uncle Eddie" is indeed Edward George O'Hanlon, and that he died a bachelor, with some wealth from his business. We do not have a copy of the will, but the following report in
the *Herald* of 24 October 1933 provides some details:

>ESTATE FALLS IN VALUE. LAND AGENT'S WILL.  
Depreciation in the value of the estate of Edward George O'Hanlon. late of Bourke Street, Melbourne, land and estate agent, led to a difficulty in the
administration of his estate, which was referred to the Acting Chief Justice (Sir Frederick Mann) in the Practice Court today. O'Hanlon died on November 5, 1932, and, when he made his will June 27, 1930, he believed that his property was worth from £13,000 to £15,000. He bequeathed £1000 each to five nephews and nieces and made gifts and annuities which require the setting aside of £160 a year. Today, O'Hanlon's estate is valued at £4800, and the annual income is £180. Being unable to give effect to all the provisions of the will, the executor (The Perpetual Trustees, Executors and Agency Co.) decided to seek a direction from the Supreme Court as to what should be done in the circumstances. Mr. C. H. A. Eager (instructed by Messrs Luke Murphy and Co.) appeared for the executor, and the beneficiaries
were represented by Mr. A. C. Morley (instructed by Messrs Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald), Mr T. S. Clyne (instructed by Mr Bernard Nolan), and Mr O. Gillard (instructed by Mr Vincent Nolan).  
Mr Eager stated that the question for determination was whether the executor should pay, in full, all such annuities as were immediately payable, without regard to the possibility that the estate would be insufficient to pay all annuities and legacies which might hereafter become payable. There was sufficient money, in the estate, he said, to pay all present demands upon it , but it was difficult, if not impossible, to put a value upon all contingencies provided for by O'Hanlon in his will, and to make reservations for all these contingencies.  
COURT'S DECISION  
The judge decided that £10 a year bequeathed to the parish priest at St. Francis's Church, Melbourne, for 21 years, should be paid in full until it appeared certain that the estate would not be sufficient to meet all demands upon it. The same direction, he said, applied to an annuity of £150 to Maureen Duff. No special provision need be made for any contingent legacies or annuities hereafter payable, except the reservation, by the executor, of the whole of the estate not required for payment of the annuities immediately payable. No portion of the surplus income of the estate should be paid out to the nephews and nieces until it was clear that there would be a residue available for them.

That little finding would not have come cheaply, with the various barristers and solicitors involved. The report refers to five nephews and nieces, but does not name them. Some more information is provided by the
[catalogue entry](https://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/FB5040D1-F329-11E9-AE98-7DDF6D2EBE8A#) in the Public Records Office of Victoria. The defendants in the case are identified as:

>Maureen Duff, Helena Galligan, Maria OHanlon, Theodore Stevens, Maxwell Stevens, Jocelyn Maria Stevens, Sheila Marie OHanlon, Richard OHanlon, Henri Lachance

The record seems silent about the identity of Maureen Duff - she may have been a long-serving employee of his firm. 
Henri Lachance 
was the priest in charge of
[St. Francis' Church](https://www.stfrancismelbourne.com/post-1929/). From its website:

> In 1929, St Francis’ Church became a Eucharistic shrine in the pastoral care of the Blessed Sacrament Congregation of priests and brothers, members of the French (now international) religious institute founded by St Peter Julian Eymard (1811-1868).  
At the invitation of Melbourne’s Archbishop Daniel Mannix (1864-1963), the Congregation initially posted five priests and two brothers to St Francis’ from the United States and Canada. The pioneer group, led by 44-year- old French Canadian Fr Henri Lachance (1885-1963), arrived at St Francis’ on All Saints’ Day in 1929.  
Almost from that moment, St Francis’ Church began to be transformed by the culture of eucharistic devotion that the Congregation transplanted to Melbourne. Exposition and perpetual adoration brought people into the church during the day. The number of masses increased and demand for confessions was sometimes overwhelming.

It may be that Edward George had a serious religious bent. We are also told:

>In 1949, a seriously ill Melbourne woman experienced a spontaneous and complete recovery from an incurable heart condition after a novena of prayers at St Francis’ Church requesting the intercession of the Congregation’s founder. Her cure was ultimately accepted by the Catholic Church as a miracle – the first in Australia to be accepted by the Church – and its authentication led to Eymard’s canonisation as a saint in 1962.

It is not every family narrative that can reference a genuine accepted miracle! But back to the defendants. Helena Galligan and Marie O'Hanlon are Edward's sisters and must have been nominated for a bequest. The other five are nieces and nephes, and are in the family tree above. In order, they died in 1984, 1992, 2014, 2019 and 1982. In particular, Sheila outlived Uncle Eddie by 87 years.

### Patrick Dennis Kavanagh O'Hanlon (1873-1943)

When he died in 1943 the *Age* of 18 September 1943 reported a simple death notice.

>O'HANLON. On September 15, at Kotupna (suddenly). Patrick Dennis Kavanagh, eldest son of the late T. and M. A..O'Hanlon, beloved brother of Edward (deceased). Michael (W.A.), Cissle (deceased), Marie, Elizabeth (Mrs. Stevens, Sydney). Helena (Mrs. Galligan, Sydney). R.I.P. 

I have the following obituary from the *Nathalia Herald* of 21 September 1943. this was taken from a photocopy somehow acquired by Sheila O'Hare. Only the years 1925-1929 have been digitised by Trove.

>Obituary.  
Cr. P.D.K. O'Hanlon  
The news that Cr. Patrick Denis Kavanagh O'Hanlon had died suddenly at his residence, Kotupna, on Wednesday afternoon came as a shock to district residents, as only the previous day he had been in Nathalia apparently in good health. As far as is known, the last person to see Mr. O'Hanlon alive was Mr. Albert Rathbone, of Kotupna, who called at his residence at about 1:30 pm on Wednesday on his way onto Nathalia to deliver some eggs that Mr. O'Hanlon had ordered on the previous day. At that time, Mr. O'Hanlon was well and cheerful. Returning to Kotupna in the evening shortly after five o'clock Mr. Rathbone noticed that Mr. O'Hanlon was lying on the ground near a gig, and on investigating found that he was dead. Indications were that Mr. O'Hanlon had loaded up his gig preparatory to driving into Nathalia and had collapsed and died when about to harness up the horse.  
The eldest son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Timothy O'Hanlon, who selected land at Kotupna in 1880, Mr. O'Hanlon was born at Kangaroo Flat in 1877. He was elected to the Numurkah shire council as one of the Moira riding councillors in 1899, and with the exception of two short breaks had been a member of the council ever since, being president in 1904 and again in 1936. Throughout his long municipal life he took a leading part in furthering many progressive moves, and it was largely through his advocacy that the Murray Valley Highway took its present route through the shire. He was a member of the executive of the Goulburn Valley and North-Eastern Council Development Association at the time of his death, and was widely known in municipal circles throughout the State. While he made municipal work his hobby, he took a leading part in many district organisations and for a long period was the Nathalia Agricultural Society's representative on the Chamber of Agriculture. He twice unsuccessfully sought to enter parliament, in 1936 contesting the Federal seat of Echuca as a Labor candidate, and on the retirement of the late Colonel Bourchier  from the State Parliament was a candidate for the Goulburn Valley seat as a Country Party representative.  
He leaves three sisters and a brother, Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Galligan, both of Sydney, Miss M. O'Hanlon, Melbourne, and Mr. Michael O'Hanlon, Western Australia.

The *Numurkah Leader* of 21 September 1943 printed an obituary, but the page was incompletely scanned and we only have the following:

>The death occurred suddenly at his home at Kotupna on Wednesday of Mr Patrick Denis Kavanagh O'Hanlon, who was well known throughout the shire and many parts of Victoria by reason of his public activities. The late Mr. O'Hanlon, who was 67 years of age, as a boy interested himself in debating societies, and when about 23 years of age entered the Numurkah Shire Council in 1890. He had represented the Moira Riding since, excepting for two intervals — once when he took up agency work in Queensland for a Victorian ..

If those dates are correct he was born in about 1876. This is inconsistent with the fact that he is usually listed as the first-born of the children. I have been unsuccessful in finding a birth record for him.

In 1936 he stood for State Parliament, 
and the *Numurkah Leader* of 1 September 1936 provided a candidate profile, which can serve as a partial obituary.  Although this would have been substantially written by Patrick himself, it is nonetheless interesting.

>Brief Resume of Candidates' Activities.  
Cr F. D. K. O'Hanlon, of Nathalia, who is a candidate for the Goulburn Valley seat, has led an active public life. As a youth in his native district of Kotupna he took part in public debates, and just after attaining his majority entered the Numurkah Shire Council, of he was President when aged 28 years, and which position he holds now, having been elected to the office for a second time nearly 12 months ago. He has led a very active public life, and has become one of the best known men in the shire. His work in connection with the Loch Garry flood protection scheme has had the effect of inducing the Commission to inquire into the claims of landholders in the district that the rates they have been called upon to pay should be rebated, and there is every hope that some relief will be granted. Cr O'Hanlon has represented the council at many important conferences, and at the moment is working in the direction of having a health inspector appointed conjointly with other shires. At the same time he is anxiously striving to have a rest room erected at Nathalia for the convenience of women travellers and district residents. He is a vice-President of the Nathalia branch of the U.C.P., and a past President of the Nathalia Agricultural Society
whose representative he is on the Chamber of Agriculture. He is a  member of the Baulkamaugh tent of the I.O.R. During his term as shire President he gave over 500 trees to schools, churches, and other bodies in order to encourage the growing and care of flora, in which subject he is deeply interested. He is a keen adherent of the policy laid down by the Country Roads Board, and in this connection has been successful in securing privileges for the shire, the portion of the Murray Valley highway that runs through portion of the Nathalia district having been strongly advocated by him. Recently he interested himself in the establishment of a forest camp for youths at the Barmah forest, and it is likely that as a result of his efforts many lads who might otherwise find themselves at a "dead end" will be usefully employed. Cr O'Hanlon has carried out his duties as shire President most conscientiously. He has attended many public functions, such as flower shows, and has not missed an opportunity of tendering civic welcomes to visitors of distinction, while he has been very ready to assist all religious bodies. He has lived in the Kotupna district for about 50 years, during which time he has engaged in farming and grazing, and has also been in business as
a general agent. By virtue of his office of shire President he was sworn in a few weeks ago as a justice of the peace. He has devoted little or no time to sport, his whole attention being given to more serious matters, but while not participating in games, he has encouraged football, cricket, and tennis clubs by accepting office and by giving trophies, the games of bowls and croquet also benefiting in this way. 

Note: The U C P is the [United Country Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_National_Party). The I O R is the
[Independent Order of Rechabites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Order_of_Rechabites).

It seems that Patrick always escalated a situation, and then went to court as a response. An example is provided by the
*Nathalia Herald and Picola, Narioka, Kotupna and Moira Advertiser* of1 March 1900. The reporter must have enjoyed writing it up.

>O'HANLON v. JENKINS. A Kotupna Assault Case.  
At Nathalia. Court of Petty Sessions last Thursday, before Messrs. F. H. Furze and E. Richardson, Js.P., Ogmore Jenkins and John Jenkins (brothers) were charged with unlawfully assaulting Edward George O'Hanlon at Kotupna on 9th February. The parties are neighbors residing on adjoining farms. Mr. Morrissy appeared for the complainant, and Mr. Johnson for defendants, who pleaded not guilty. At the outset Mr. Morrissy offered to withdraw the charges if defendants would apologise and pay the costs. This offer was not accepted by the defendants, and complainant then proceeded to state his case.  
Edward George O'Hanlon, residing at Kotupna, stated that on the 9th February he was watering some stock at the Deep Creek when he heard some voices in angry altercation proceeding from the bed of the creek. Upon going to see what was wrong witness saw his own brother, Patrick D. K. O'Hanlon, and the defendant, Ogmore Jenkins, each trying to drive a pig up the bank. Witness called out, "What's all this about ?" Patrick O'Hanlon replied, "Jenkins has shot two of our pigs and now wants to take this sow home to shoot her also." Patrick O'Hanlon then started to drive the sow up the bank towards his home. Ogmore Jenkins said, "Our boar's at your place, in your stable, and Pat says he won't let us have it before we pay £5." Witness went down to assist his brother drive the sow up the bank. He also said to Jenkins " You'd better
go home while you are happy." Ogmore Jenkins rushed at witness and said, "I'll kill this —— sow or I'll kill you." Just then witness heard a noise behind him and looked round in time to dodge a blow aimed at him by the other defendant, John Jenkins, who had arrived on the scene with a stick. Ogmore Jenkins then struck witness with a stick and witness fell on to his knees, the blood gushing out of a wound in his head, and saturating his clothing. Patrick O'Hanlon who had been driving the sow home then rushed back and attacked the Jenkins with his stockwhip. After this witness and his brother went home and the two defendants did likewise. Subsequently witness went across to Jenkins house and asked them why they had struck him. Ogmore Jenkins said, " You are the only man among the O'Hanlon's." Witness then came into Nathalia and had the wound dressed by Dr. Mathwin.  
Patrick D. K O'Hanlon, brother of last witness, deposed that on the 9th February he went to Jenkins to get some pigs which had strayed over there. Witness carried a whip to drive the pigs. Heard some shooting and meeting Ogmore Jenkins said to him, "Who's firing?" He replied, "Jack is shooting your pigs, father told him to." Witness next saw John Jenkins with a gun; who said he had potted two. Witness went down to the dam. Ogmore Jenkins rode up on horseback. Witness said, "You'e funny sort of neighbors, whenever our pigs or stock get into your place you impound or shoot them." Ogmore Jenkins replied, "That's the best way for us to live." Witness retorted. "That's the way you fellows have lived ever since you came here." Ogmore Jenkins said "Oh, you're easily upset." Witness then proceeded to drive the pigs home and Ogmore Jenkins rode away ; he returned shortly afterwards, and said "Do you know where our boar is?" Witness said, "Yes he's at my place but you won't get him without my permission." He said he would and rode off to witness' place. Witness ran over also and got there soon. Told Ogmore Jenkins that before he got the boar back he would have to pay £5. He replied, "I will go and get my gun and shoot
one of your sows that's in our stubble paddock." He singled out a sow, which was heavy in young — one of the lot of pigs which witness had been driving home from the dam — and said he would take her home and shoot her. He rode his horse at witness and said, "Clear home, or I'll do for the pig and you too." Witness replied, " I'll die in the last ditch before you shall have the pig." Witness saw that Ogmore Jenkins was not frightened of him a little bit. He commenced to try and drive the sow one way and witness tried to drive her another. They were then in the bed of the creek. The sow could not get up the bank. Ogmore Jenkins struck at witness with a stick across the pig. He also beat the sow unmercifully, causing her to bleed. He said he would like to "have a go" at witness and "spoil my pretty nose." He broke one stick beating the sow, and picked up another stick, and said to witness "Fancy a fellow like you being a councillor." Just then witness' brother Edward came along and said, " What's up ? " Witness said, "Jenkins has shot two of our pigs and Ogmore wants to take this sow home and shoot her too." Edward said to Jenkins, "Leave the pig alone and go home," but he said to Edward, " I'll do for the pig and you too ." Whilst they were arguing witness drove the sow up the bank towards home. John Jenkins then came up and appeared to be making a rush at Edward O'Hanlon. Then Ogmore Jenkins struck Edward a blow on the head with a heavy stick, Edward sank down and called out, "Come here, Pat." Both defendants were standing over Edward hitting him with their fists and sticks. Witness ran up and plied his stockwhip about Ogmore Jenkins, who ran away.
John Jenkins seized the whip and said, "You hit me with that whip if you dare." Then he cleared too. Witness' brother never struck either of the Jenkins'. Subsequently his brother went over to Jenkins' house to show Ogmore the wound which, he had inflicted. Witness saw that Mr. Jenkins, senr., and his two sons were there, and as there was three to one he went over and joined his brother. Edward said to Ogmore Jenkins, "What did you hit me for?" The father said, "Good enough for you. You'll find them tough little fellows." Witness induced his brother to come away. He was saturated with blood, from his head down to his boots. After that he brought his brother in to see Dr. Mathwin.  
(Cross-examination and other witnesses omitted.)  
The Chairman (Mr. Furze) said the Bench considered such a quarrel between neighbors most unfortunate. It was an illustration of the old saying that "bad fences make bad neighbors." Trespass of stock however was no excuse for personal assault. Each defendant would be fined £1, and the costs, £2 7s., would be equally divided. Distress to issue in default of payment.

The *Leader* of 22 May 1909 reported:

>Messrs. Powers, Rutherford and Co. (in conjunction with Muntz Bros, and Heighway) report the sale by public auction of Mr. P. D. K. O'Hanlon's farm at Kotupna, comprising 631 acres, at £4 10/ per acre.

### The Sisters

Honora Cecelia died in 1894, at the age of 15. From the suggestion of several of Michael's poems it seems that she might have died of fever, in a protracted and tragic fashion.

Marie died a spinster in 1966, aged about 87. She nursed he mother in her last years, and perhaps lived in the family home in St Kilda until the end.

Elizabeth Frances was a nurse, and her
[military record](http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=7991919)
shows she joined up in December 1916. She was sent to India later that month, and arrived in Bombay in January 1917. On 1 January 1919 she married Arthur Raphael Steven at St Patrick's Cathedral in Bangalore. Arthur seems to have been a medical doctor in the British Army, and trained at Glasgow University. She resigned her appointment in May 1919, and left for Australia on 1 December 1919 "with infant", which I take to be Theodore Michael Steven.

Dr Steven followed them to Australia. He was 
[registered to practice](http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article220078738)
on 9 February 1921. They lived for some time in Gladesville, Sydney, and had two more children. It would seem they eventually separated. Arthur moved to Queensland, and then to Melbourne. Elizabeth died in Sydney, in 1959.

Helena Josephine married Michael Galligan in St Kilda in 1917. They lived in Sydney. They do not seem to have had any children.
